"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained a lot of attention from
machine learning community due to their ability to learn and mimic an input
data distribution. GANs consist of a discriminator and a generator working in
tandem playing a min-max game to learn a target underlying data distribution;
when fed with data-points sampled from a simpler distribution (like uniform or
Gaussian distribution). Once trained, they allow synthetic generation of
examples sampled from the target distribution. We investigate the application
of GANs to generate synthetic feature vectors used for speech emotion
recognition. Specifically, we investigate two set ups: (i) a vanilla GAN that
learns the distribution of a lower dimensional representation of the actual
higher dimensional feature vector and, (ii) a conditional GAN that learns the
distribution of the higher dimensional feature vectors conditioned on the
labels or the emotional class to which it belongs. As a potential practical
application of these synthetically generated samples, we measure any
improvement in a classifier's performance when the synthetic data is used along
with real data for training. We perform cross-validation analyses followed by a
cross-corpus study.",of a SVM trained on synthetic Real open SMILE improved conditional 60 29 samples along with real training samples for different scenarios Table 2 Classification results of using synthetically generated for cross corpus experiments vectors in the test set Data set U AR Data set U AR Only synthetic 2 D 40 17 Only 2 D code vectors 41 27 2 D code vectors 97 09 2 D code vector Synthetic 41 54 Improved conditional 35 23 Only real open SMILE 45 14 dimensional complex distribution Only improved conditional 33 96 Real open SMILE baseline conditional 43 79 4 3 Cross corpus experiments Real open SMILE improved conditional 45 40 Having studied the convergence of GAN architectures an deval generalized distribution manifold where the open SMILE fe a u a ting the quality of synthetically generated samples produced ture vectors lie The experiments on conditional GAN show by them in a single corpora setting we now move to performing that a generator s job to estimate a more complex PDF from a cross corpus evaluations The objective of this experiment is to simpler PDF is more complex than a disc rim in at or s job which investigate if synthetically generated samples can be used dur is to distinguish between fake and real samples Hence we had ing classification on an external corpus as opposed to being ap to incorporate tricks like updating the generator more times for pli cable for only in domain tasks We use I EMO CAP for train a single update of disc rim in at or or keeping the learning rate of ing and MSP IMPROV 14 as our testing set MSP IMPROV generator more than that of a disc rim in at or We also ex peri like I EMO CAP also has actors participating in dyadic con men ted with reducing the number of trainable parameters in a vers at ions which has then been segmented into utterances and disc rim in at or but it didn the lp in this case by a larger amount annotated by eva lua tors There are 7798 utterances in total While we see an improvement in performance of SVM when spanned across the same four emotion classes However the real data is appended with synthetic data however the improve distribution across classes was highly unbalanced with the num ment isn t much This is probably because the synthetic vec ber of utterances belonging to happy neutral class more than tors after all are sampled from a distribution that mimics the three times the number of angry sad samples This prompted us real data distribution something which the SVM class i fieri sal to use it as a test set rather than training set The loss curves for a ready using for training Also the smaller size of data set might conditional GAN with the same set up used in cross validations be hampering the capabilities of our GAN models Cross cor experiments is shown in Figure 5 We observe that the ad ver pus results showing similar trend as cross validation indicate s arial errors converge even if the test set is a different corpus that the models are indeed general iz able across datasets with than the training set Results in Table 3 show a similar trend as different priors cross validation results In the future we aim to further analyze other GAN arch i tec ture s for the task of emotion classification 15 A similar ap,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"We describe a new software framework for fast training of generalized linear
models. The framework, named Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML), combines recent
advances in machine learning systems and algorithms in a nested manner to
reflect the hierarchical architecture of modern computing systems. We prove
theoretically that such a hierarchical system can accelerate training in
distributed environments where intra-node communication is cheaper than
inter-node communication. Additionally, we provide a review of the
implementation of Snap ML in terms of GPU acceleration, pipelining,
communication patterns and software architecture, highlighting aspects that
were critical for achieving high performance. We evaluate the performance of
Snap ML in both single-node and multi-node environments, quantifying the
benefit of the hierarchical scheme and the data streaming functionality, and
comparing with other widely-used machine learning software frameworks. Finally,
we present a logistic regression benchmark on the Criteo Terabyte Click Logs
dataset and show that Snap ML achieves the same test loss an order of magnitude
faster than any of the previously reported results, including those obtained
using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.",In this work we have described Snap ML a new framework for fast training of generalized linear models Snap ML can exploit modern computing infrastructure consisting of multiple machines that contain both CPUs and GPUs The framework is hierarchical in nature allowing it to adapt to cloud based deployments where the cost of communication between nodes maybe relatively high It is also able to effectively leverage modern high speed interconnects to hide the cost of transferring data between CPU and GPU when training on datasets that are too large to fit into GPU memory We have shown that Snap ML can provide significantly faster training than existing frameworks in both single node and multi node benchmarks On one of the largest publicly available datasets we have shown that Snap ML can be used to train a Logistic Regression class i fier in 1 5 minutes more than an order of magnitude faster than any of the previously reported results Acknowledgement The authors would like to thank Martin Jag gi for valuable input regarding the algorithmic structure of our system Michael Kaufman n and Adrian Sch p bach for testing and bug fixes Ku bil ayAt as u for contributing code for load balancing and Man ol is S if a lak is and Urs Egg er for setting up vital infrastructure We would also like to thank our colleagues Christoph Hag le it ner and Cristiano Mal ossi for providing access to heterogeneous compute resources and providing valuable support when scheduling large scale jobs Finally we would also like to thank Hillery Hunter Paul Crum ley and I HsinChu ng for providing access to the servers that were used to perform the tera scale benchmarking and Bill Armstrong for his guidance and support of this project Trademark service mark registered trademark of International Business Machines Corporation in the United States other countries or both Intel Xeon is a trademarks or registered trademarks of Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries in the United States and other countries Java and all Java based trademarks and logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle and or its affiliates Tensor Flow the Tensor Flow logo and any related marks are trademarks of Google Inc The Apache Software Foundation AS F owns all Apache related trademarks service marks and graphic logos on behalf of our Apache project communities and the names of all Apache projects are trademarks of the AS F,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"We propose a class of very simple modifications of gradient descent and
stochastic gradient descent. We show that when applied to a large variety of
machine learning problems, ranging from logistic regression to deep neural
nets, the proposed surrogates can dramatically reduce the variance, allow to
take a larger step size, and improve the generalization accuracy. The methods
only involve multiplying the usual (stochastic) gradient by the inverse of a
positive definitive matrix (which can be computed efficiently by FFT) with a
low condition number coming from a one-dimensional discrete Laplacian or its
high order generalizations. It also preserves the mean and increases the
smallest component and decreases the largest component. The theory of
Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations demonstrates that the implicit
version of the new algorithm is almost the same as doing gradient descent on a
new function which (i) has the same global minima as the original function and
(ii) is ``more convex"". Moreover, we show that optimization algorithms with
these surrogates converge uniformly in the discrete Sobolev $H_\sigma^p$ sense
and reduce the optimality gap for convex optimization problems. The code is

"Neural networks in many varieties are touted as very powerful machine
learning tools because of their ability to distill large amounts of information
from different forms of data, extracting complex features and enabling powerful
classification abilities. In this study, we use neural networks to extract
features from both images and numeric data and use these extracted features as
inputs for other machine learning models, namely support vector machines (SVMs)
and k-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNNs), in order to see if
neural-network-extracted features enhance the capabilities of these models. We
tested 7 different neural network architectures in this manner, 4 for images
and 3 for numeric data, training each for varying lengths of time and then
comparing the results of the neural network independently to those of an SVM
and KNN on the data, and finally comparing these results to models of SVM and
KNN trained using features extracted via the neural network architecture. This
process was repeated on 3 different image datasets and 2 different numeric
datasets. The results show that, in many cases, the features extracted using
the neural network significantly improve the capabilities of SVMs and KNNs
compared to running these algorithms on the raw features, and in some cases
also surpass the performance of the neural network alone. This in turn suggests
that it may be a reasonable practice to use neural networks as a means to
extract features for classification by other machine learning models for some

"It is a widely accepted fact that data representations intervene noticeably
in machine learning tools. The more they are well defined the better the
performance results are. Feature extraction-based methods such as autoencoders
are conceived for finding more accurate data representations from the original
ones. They efficiently perform on a specific task in terms of 1) high accuracy,
2) large short term memory and 3) low execution time. Echo State Network (ESN)
is a recent specific kind of Recurrent Neural Network which presents very rich
dynamics thanks to its reservoir-based hidden layer. It is widely used in
dealing with complex non-linear problems and it has outperformed classical
approaches in a number of tasks including regression, classification, etc. In
this paper, the noticeable dynamism and the large memory provided by ESN and
the strength of Autoencoders in feature extraction are gathered within an ESN
Recurrent Autoencoder (ESN-RAE). In order to bring up sturdier alternative to
conventional reservoir-based networks, not only single layer basic ESN is used
as an autoencoder, but also Multi-Layer ESN (ML-ESN-RAE). The new features,
once extracted from ESN's hidden layer, are applied to classification tasks.
The classification rates rise considerably compared to those obtained when
applying the original data features. An accuracy-based comparison is performed
between the proposed recurrent AEs and two variants of an ELM feed-forward AEs
(Basic and ML) in both of noise free and noisy environments. The empirical
study reveals the main contribution of recurrent connections in improving the

therefore learn better predictive models than if we simply used the target

"Despite the considerable success enjoyed by machine learning techniques in
practice, numerous studies demonstrated that many approaches are vulnerable to
attacks. An important class of such attacks involves adversaries changing
features at test time to cause incorrect predictions. Previous investigations

situations an adversary's decision is aimed at a collection of learners, rather

"In machine learning (ML) security, attacks like evasion, model stealing or membership inference are generally studied in individually. Previous work has also shown a relationship between some attacks and decision function curvature of the targeted model. Consequently, we study an ML model allowing direct control over the decision surface curvature: Gaussian Process classifiers (GPCs). For evasion, we find that changing GPC's curvature to be robust against one attack algorithm boils down to enabling a different norm or attack algorithm to succeed. This is backed up by our formal analysis showing that static security guarantees are opposed to learning. Concerning intellectual property, we show formally that lazy learning does not necessarily leak all information when applied. In practice, often a seemingly secure curvature can be found. For example, we are able to secure GPC against empirical membership inference by proper configuration. In this configuration, however, the GPC's hyper-parameters are leaked, e.g. model reverse engineering succeeds. We conclude that attacks on classification should not be studied in isolation, but in relation to each other.",showing that Contributions Our formal analysis confirms vulnerability static security guarantees are opposed to learning Concerning intellectual property we show formally that lazy learning does not towards evasion at test time once the GP has learned Due necessarily leak all information when applied In practice often to its mathematical form GP allows to analytically compute a seemingly secure curvature can be found For example we are the length scale iff the training data is known and only one able to secure GP C against empirical membership inference by length scale used We further conduct a broad empirical study proper configuration In this configuration however the GP C s of vulnerability on six data sets focusing on decision fun c hyper parameters are leaked e g model reverse engineering succeeds We conclude that attacks on classification should not tion curvature To this end we introduce two model reverse be studied in isolation but in relation to each other engineering attacks one for GP s length scale one for the kernel Decision function curvature often only changes the,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Clustering using neural networks has recently demonstrated promising
performance in machine learning and computer vision applications. However, the
performance of current approaches is limited either by unsupervised learning or
their dependence on large set of labeled data samples. In this paper, we
propose ClusterNet that uses pairwise semantic constraints from very few
labeled data samples (<5% of total data) and exploits the abundant unlabeled
data to drive the clustering approach. We define a new loss function that uses
pairwise semantic similarity between objects combined with constrained k-means
clustering to efficiently utilize both labeled and unlabeled data in the same
framework. The proposed network uses convolution autoencoder to learn a latent
representation that groups data into k specified clusters, while also learning
the cluster centers simultaneously. We evaluate and compare the performance of

"Adversarial attacks involve adding, small, often imperceptible, perturbations

Unlike in many attack strategies, we show that the same trained generator is
capable of attacking new images without explicitly optimizing on them. We
evaluate our attack on a trained Faster R-CNN face detector on the cropped
300-W face dataset where we manage to reduce the number of detected faces to
$0.5\%$ of all originally detected faces. In a different experiment, also on
300-W, we demonstrate the robustness of our attack to a JPEG compression based

"The study of genetic variants can help find correlating population groups to identify cohorts that are predisposed to common diseases and explain differences in disease susceptibility and how patients react to drugs. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to identify interacting GVs to understand their complex phenotypic traits. Since the performance of a learning algorithm not only depends on the size and nature of the data but also on the quality of underlying representation, deep neural networks can learn non-linear mappings that allow transforming GVs data into more clustering and classification friendly representations than manual feature selection. In this paper, we proposed convolutional embedded networks in which we combine two DNN architectures called convolutional embedded clustering and convolutional autoencoder classifier for clustering individuals and predicting geographic ethnicity based on GVs, respectively. We employed CAE-based representation learning on 95 million GVs from the 1000 genomes and Simons genome diversity projects. Quantitative and qualitative analyses with a focus on accuracy and scalability show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as VariantSpark and ADMIXTURE. In particular, CEC can cluster targeted population groups in 22 hours with an adjusted rand index of 0.915, the normalized mutual information of 0.92, and the clustering accuracy of 89%. Contrarily, the CAE classifier can predict the geographic ethnicity of unknown samples with an F1 and Mathews correlation coefficient(MCC) score of 0.9004 and 0.8245, respectively.

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the state-of-the-art technique for
machine learning tasks in various applications. However, due to their size and
the computational complexity, large DNNs are not readily deployable on edge
devices in real-time. To manage complexity and accelerate computation, network
compression techniques based on pruning and quantization have been proposed and
shown to be effective in reducing network size. However, such network
compression can result in irregular matrix structures that are mismatched with
modern hardware-accelerated platforms, such as graphics processing units (GPUs)
designed to perform the DNN matrix multiplications in a structured
(block-based) way. We propose MPDCompress, a DNN compression algorithm based on
matrix permutation decomposition via random mask generation. In-training
application of the masks molds the synaptic weight connection matrix to a
sub-graph separation format. Aided by the random permutations, a
hardware-desirable block matrix is generated, allowing for a more efficient
implementation and compression of the network. To show versatility, we
empirically verify MPDCompress on several network models, compression rates,
and image datasets. On the LeNet 300-100 model (MNIST dataset), Deep MNIST, and
CIFAR10, we achieve 10 X network compression with less than 1% accuracy loss

"Learning useful representations without supervision remains a key challenge
in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative
model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector
Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways:
the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the
prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent
representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the
VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of ""posterior collapse"" --
where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful
autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing
these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high

"The Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) are a popular class of machine learning models for analyzing sequential data. Their training on modern GPUs, however, is limited by the GPU memory capacity. Our profiling results of the LSTM RNN-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model reveal that feature maps of the attention and RNN layers form the memory bottleneck and runtime is unevenly distributed across different layers when training on GPUs. Based on these two observations, we propose to recompute the feature maps rather than stashing them persistently in the GPU memory. While the idea of feature map recomputation has been considered before, existing solutions fail to deliver satisfactory footprint reduction, as they do not address two key challenges. For each feature map recomputation to be effective and efficient, its effect on (1) the total memory footprint, and (2) the total execution time has to be carefully estimated. To this end, we propose *Echo*, a new compiler-based optimization scheme that addresses the first challenge with a practical mechanism that estimates the memory benefits of recomputation over the entire computation graph, and the second challenge by non-conservatively estimating the recomputation overhead leveraging layer specifics. *Echo* reduces the GPU memory footprint automatically and transparently without any changes required to the training source code, and is effective for models beyond LSTM RNNs. We evaluate *Echo* on numerous state-of-the-art machine learning workloads on real systems with modern GPUs and observe footprint reduction ratios of 1.89X on average and 3.13X maximum. Such reduction can be converted into faster training with a larger batch size, savings in GPU energy consumption (e.g., training with one GPU as fast as with four), and/or an increase in the maximum number of layers under the same GPU memory budget.",When a layer completes its own forward or backward 1 which is marked as the feature map that has to be stashed pass its work space if previously requested can be freed Therefore the memory allocated for those edges cannot be released back to the storage pool resulting in four persistent storage units by the time the forward pass completes 2 If re computation is used those four dependency edges can be replaced with only one edge on the input to Node 1 3 This releases storage pressure as the inputs to Node 2 4 can now be taken by their respective outputs and hence do not need to be stashed anymore but it comes with the cost of having to redo the forward computation when the backward pass starts 4 This certainly comes with runtime overhead Fig 4 Memory Consumption Breakdown by but such overhead can be controlled if the re computed nodes Layer Types Left and Data Structures Right shown in gray in Figure 6 b are restricted to those that are computationally cheap Hence selective re computation has the Figure 4 shows the NMT memory consumption breakdown potential to reduce the memory footprint at small runtime cost with the left bar classifying memory consumption by layer types and the right by data structures The two striped bars at the bottom show the discrepancy between the total amount of memory consumption reported by the memory profiler versus the actual memory usage given by the nvidia s mi tool 46 Such discrepancy can be caused by memory fragmentation or a Baseline allocations by the CUDA libraries 77 We conclude from the figure that the feature maps of the attention layers followed by RNN and output are the major memory consumers as they are responsible for a total of 87 8 0 GB of the GPU b Re computation memory used by NMT5 75 Fig 6 A Computation Graph with Re computation Applied Red Arrows denote Persistent Feature Maps Storage C Runtime Breakdown In practice however we observe that the current state of the To motivate the use of selective re computation approach we art re computation approach has limited benefits on the NMT do a runtime profile analysis that shows the runtime distribution training Table I compares the training performance and GPU across different layers Figure 5 shows the NMT runtime memory footprint between training with and without selective breakdown on one training iteration The profile is obtained re computation where the re computation implementation is from the NV Prof tool 48 We observe that the runtime is based on the prior work 11 We observe that re computation unevenly distributed across different layers with 50 going causes the performance to drop by 17 and it can only give into the fully connected layers and the other 50 into many a footprint reduction of 27 in return which does not provide small compute kernels The longest kernel of the latter runs enough memory space to increase the performance by for for only 5 ms the m shadow bar represents the tensor library example increasing the batch size backend of MX Net and consists of multiple CUDA kernels Baseline Che net al 11 D Selective Re computation Avg Throughput samples s 1192 983 GPU Memory Footprint GB 10 0 7 4 Given that the GPU memory consumption limits training TABLE I NMT 21 Training with without Re computation performance and that the execution time is distributed unevenly,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Adapting deep networks to new concepts from a few examples is challenging, due to the high computational requirements of standard fine-tuning procedures. Most work on few-shot learning has thus focused on simple learning techniques for adaptation, such as nearest neighbours or gradient descent. Nonetheless, the machine learning literature contains a wealth of methods that learn non-deep models very efficiently. In this paper, we propose to use these fast convergent methods as the main adaptation mechanism for few-shot learning. The main idea is to teach a deep network to use standard machine learning tools, such as ridge regression, as part of its own internal model, enabling it to quickly adapt to novel data. This requires back-propagating errors through the solver steps. While normally the cost of the matrix operations involved in such a process would be significant, by using the Woodbury identity we can make the small number of examples work to our advantage. We propose both closed-form and iterative solvers, based on ridge regression and logistic regression components. Our methods constitute a simple and novel approach to the problem of few-shot learning and achieve performance competitive with or superior to the state of the art on three benchmarks.",Contributions within the few shot learning paradigm In this work we evaluated our proposed methods R 2 D 2 and LR D 2 in the few shot learning scenario Fei Fei et al 2006 Lake et al 2015 Vi ny als et al 2016 Ravi La rochelle 2017 Harihara n Gir s hick 2017 which consists in learning how to discriminate between images given one or very few examples For methods tackling this problem it is common practice to organise the training procedure in two nested loops The inner loop is used to solve the actual few shot classification problem while the outer loop serves as a guidance for the former by gradually modifying the inductive bias of the base learner Vil alta Dr is si 2002 Differently from standard classification benchmarks the few shot ones enforce that classes are disjoint between data set splits In the literature e g Vi nya lse tal 2016 the very small classification problems with unseen classes solved within the inner loop have often been referred to as episodes or tasks Considering the general few shot learning paradigm just described methods in the recent literature mostly differ for the type of learner they use in the inner loop and the amount of per episode adaptability they allow For example at the one end of the spectrum in terms of amount of adaptability we can find methods such as MAM L Finn et al 2017 which learns how to efficiently fine tune the parameters of a neural network with few iterations of SGD On the other end we have methods based on metric learning such as prototypical networks Snell et al 2017 and relation network Sun get al 2018 which are fast but do not perform adaptation Note that the amount of adaptation to a new episode i e a new classification problem with unseen classes is not at all indicative of the performance in few shot learning benchmarks As a matter of fact both Snell et al 2017 and Sun get al 2018 achieve higher accuracy than MAM L Nonetheless adaptability is a desirable property as it allows more design flexibility Within this landscape our work proposes a novel technique R 2 D 2 that does allow per episode adaptation while at the sametime being fast Table 4 and achieving strong performance Table 1 The key innovation is to use a simple and differentiable solver such as ridge regression within the inner loop which requires back propagating through the solution of a learning problem Crucially its closed form solution and the use of the Woodbury identity particularly advantageous in the low data regime allow this non trivial endeavour to be efficient We further demonstrate that this strategy is not limited to the ridge regression case but it can also be extended to other solvers LR D 2 by dividing the problem into a short series of weighted least squares problems Murphy 2012 Chapter 8 3 4 Disambiguation from the multi task learning paradigm Our work and more generally the few shot learning literature as a whole is related to the multi task learning paradigm Car u an a 1998 Ruder 2017 However several crucial differences exist In terms of setup multi task learning methods are trained to solve a fixed set of T tasks or domains Attest time the same T tasks or domains are encountered For instance the popular Office Caltech Gon get al 2012 data set is constructed by considering all the images from 10 classes present in 4 different datasets the domains For multi task learning the splits span the domains but contain all the 10 classes Conversely few shot learning datasets have splits with disjoint sets of classes i e each split s classes are not contained in other splits Moreover only a few examples shots can be used as training data within one episode while in multi task learning this limitation is not present For this reason meta learning methods applied to few shot learning e g ours Vi nya lse tal 2016 Finn et al 2017 Ravi La rochelle 2017 Mishra et al 2018 crucially take into account adaptation already during the training process to mimic the test time setting de facto learning how to learn from limited data The importance of considering adaptation during training Considering adaptation during train ing is also one of the main traits that differentiate our approach from basic transfer learning approaches in which a neural network is first pre trained on one data set task and then adapted to a different data set task by simply adapting the final layer s e g Yo s in ski et al 2014 Chu et al 2016 To better illustrate this point we conducted a baseline experiment First we pre trained for a standard classification problem the same 4 layers CNN architecture using the same training datasets We simply added a final fully connected layer with 64 outputs like the number of classes in the training splits and used the cross entropy loss Then we used the convolutional

"Syndromic surveillance detects and monitors individual and population health
indicators through sources such as emergency department records. Automated
classification of these records can improve outbreak detection speed and
diagnosis accuracy. Current syndromic systems rely on hand-coded keyword-based
methods to parse written fields and may benefit from the use of modern
supervised-learning classifier models. In this paper we implement two recurrent
neural network models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated
recurrent unit (GRU) cells and compare them to two traditional bag-of-words
classifiers: multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) and a support vector machine (SVM).
The MNB classifier is one of only two machine learning algorithms currently
being used for syndromic surveillance. All four models are trained to predict
diagnostic code groups as defined by Clinical Classification Software, first to
predict from discharge diagnosis, then from chief complaint fields. The
classifiers are trained on 3.6 million de-identified emergency department
records from a single United States jurisdiction. We compare performance of
these models primarily using the F1 score. Using discharge diagnoses, the LSTM
classifier performs best, though all models exhibit an F1 score above 96.00.
The GRU performs best on chief complaints (F1=47.38), and MNB with bigrams
performs worst (F1=39.40). Certain syndrome types are easier to detect than
others. For examples, chief complaints using the GRU model predicts
alcohol-related disorders well (F1=78.91) but predicts influenza poorly
(F1=14.80). In all instances, the RNN models outperformed the bag-of-word
classifiers, suggesting deep learning models could substantially improve the
automatic classification of unstructured text for syndromic surveillance.",on difficult tasks including zero shot translation i e translating between language pairs not explicitly seen during training Johnson et al 2016 Going beyond RNNs even models invented primarily for non linguistic tasks like image classification have been used to solve complex problems with text like understanding the sentiment behind user generated restaurant ratings and product reviews Kim 2014 Blu n som 2014 Zhang 2015 Since chief complaint classification is a kind of text categorization methods good for the latter serve the former as well Thus we compare several popular open source supervised learning algorithms for classifying chief complaints in contrast to proprietary systems that have been developed specifically for syn dr omi c surveillance Overview of Current Methods for Text Categorization Current methods for text categorization are generally non sequential models like na ve Bayes and S VMs or sequential models like one dimensional convolutional neural networks CNN s and RNNs Non sequential models and CNN s have achieved state of the art results on many benchmark datasets including movie reviews Wang 2012 product reviews Zhang 2015 and news articles Johnson 2014 Likewise RNN models especially long short term memory LSTM neural networks Hoch reiter 1997,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Inspired by number series tests to measure human intelligence, we suggest
number sequence prediction tasks to assess neural network models' computational
powers for solving algorithmic problems. We define the complexity and
difficulty of a number sequence prediction task with the structure of the
smallest automaton that can generate the sequence. We suggest two types of
number sequence prediction problems: the number-level and the digit-level
problems. The number-level problems format sequences as 2-dimensional grids of
digits and the digit-level problems provide a single digit input per a time
step. The complexity of a number-level sequence prediction can be defined with
the depth of an equivalent combinatorial logic, and the complexity of a
digit-level sequence prediction can be defined with an equivalent state
automaton for the generation rule. Experiments with number-level sequences
suggest that CNN models are capable of learning the compound operations of
sequence generation rules, but the depths of the compound operations are
limited. For the digit-level problems, simple GRU and LSTM models can solve
some problems with the complexity of finite state automata. Memory augmented
models such as Stack-RNN, Attention, and Neural Turing Machines can solve the
reverse-order task which has the complexity of simple pushdown automaton.
However, all of above cannot solve general Fibonacci, Arithmetic or Geometric
sequence generation problems that represent the complexity of queue automata or
Turing machines. The results show that our number sequence prediction problems
effectively evaluate machine learning models' computational capabilities.",show that complexities of number level sequence prediction problems can effectively predict the hardness of learning Figure 7 compares the learning curves of the models with various configurations and sequence data The models s uc ces s fully learn the rules from both the mixed set of primary sequences and the sequences generated by a ternary relation However the patterns of the learning curves are different With the mixed set of primary sequences the learning curves of the models show uniform convexity without a saddle point Also there is no clear advantage of using deeper models However the learning curves with the sequences of a com pound rule have saddle points where we suspect the models find breakthroughs Moreover we can observe the advantages of using deeper models Therefore it can be concluded that deep learning models tend to learn complex but less difficult combinatorial logic rather than the equivalent shallow but wide representations Meanwhile the last learning curves show that the CNN model finds it hard to learn the logic with the complexities more than three The quaternary operator with base 5 has a smaller combinatorial width than a decimal ternary operator but the model cannot learn the rule of the former Digit level Sequence Prediction Experiment Setup The purpose of the digit level sequence prediction experiments is to find complexity limits of the models The first type of the sequences is a progression with a fixed d if ference which can be understood as a variation of number counting sequences We use the difference of 17 to observe the carry rules more often The firstterm of a training data is chosen from the range of 0 9000 and that of a vali dati on

relation A cid 98 1 3 A cid 99 where the first n 1 n terms are randomly chosen from 0 4000 during the train ing and 4000 6000 for validations The task also requires a smaller queue automaton since it has to remember only one previous number at a time The last experiment tests the models with the reverse order task which has the complexity of a push down automaton Since a reverse order problem of fixed length can be solved by a finite automaton we train the models with n 1 12 and validate the models with n 16 to force the models to learn a push down automaton Result Figure 10 shows that GRU and LSTM based mod els are capable of simulating finite state automata Although the GRU model shows better performance than the LSTM model both are notable to solve the problems that require queue or push down automata as seen in Table 1 Training error rates of GRU and LSTM models on reverse order task converges around 0 01 suggesting that the models are capable of simulating finite state automata for generating palindromes with a limited length The error examples from the general Fibonacci sequence prediction task in Figure 11 show the strategies of the models The models remember relationships

"Channel modeling is a critical topic when considering designing, learning, or

a generative adversarial networks (GANs) to jointly approximate a wireless
channel response model (e.g. from real black box measurements) and optimize for
an efficient modulation scheme over it using machine learning. This approach
worked to some degree, but was unable to produce accurate probability

"Multi-label learning problems have manifested themselves in various machine
learning applications. The key to successful multi-label learning algorithms
lies in the exploration of inter-label correlations, which usually incur great
computational cost. Another notable factor in multi-label learning is that the
label vectors are usually extremely sparse, especially when the candidate label
vocabulary is very large and only a few instances are assigned to each
category. Recently, a label space transformation (LST) framework has been
proposed targeting these challenges. However, current methods based on LST
usually suffer from information loss in the label space dimension reduction
process and fail to address the sparsity problem effectively. In this paper, we
propose a distribution-based label space transformation (DLST) model. By
defining the distribution based on the similarity of label vectors, a more
comprehensive label structure can be captured. Then, by minimizing
KL-divergence of two distributions, the information of the original label space
can be approximately preserved in the latent space. Consequently, multi-label
classifier trained using the dense latent codes yields better performance. The
leverage of distribution enables DLST to fill out additional information about
the label correlations. This endows DLST the capability to handle label set
sparsity and training data sparsity in multi-label learning problems. With the
optimal latent code, a kernel logistic regression function is learned for the
mapping from feature space to the latent space. Then ML-KNN is employed to
recover the original label vector from the transformed latent code. Extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DLST not only
achieves high classification performance but also is computationally more
efficient.",to recover the original label vector from the latent code of are translated back to the original label space via a decoding each instance The proposed model can also be extended with process thus the original labels for test instances can be kernel tricks to deal with nonlinear regression from original recovered Moreover algorithms with both label space and feature to the latent code feature space dimension reduction have been proposed such Since the proposed model is capable of tackling label set as conditional principal label space transformation 9 In sparsity and training data sparsity Real world examples of addition 20 45 take a more direct approach by formulating these two types of sparsity are missing data and limited the label prediction problem as learning a low rank linear training data The performance of DL ST is relatively stable mapping from feature space to label space However these across varying missing ratios or training data ratios This methods usually suffer from information loss and depend on can be attributed to the distribution used in DL ST Rather the reduced dimension of the latent space than limited to the given label vectors DL ST captures the In recent years the proliferation of labels pose great chal whole distribution of the label space by fitting the observed len geto existing multi label learning methods Due to the large label vectors using a distribution with maximal variance and label vocabulary the label vectors are usually characterized transmits the distribution to the latent space by high dimensionality and remarkable sparsity The sparsity The contributions of this paper are originates from two sources 1 For each instance only a The proposed method takes advantage of distribution to small number of labels are present namely the label vector has capture more comprehensive inter label correlations in little support Sparsity I 2 For a certain set of labels very the original label space and transmits it to the latent space few training instances are assigned to it Sparsity II In the The dense latent code learned by DL ST successfully following paper we refer to these two types of sparsity as label addresses label set sparsity by distinguishing concurrent set sparsity and training data sparsity respectively Although label patterns from most other unrelated labels the label space dimension reduction approaches target to The proposed model effectively alleviates the requirement address this problem the performance of the reduced latent on training data size to achieve high multi label class if i space is not satisfying in terms of prediction accuracy and cation performance computational complexity The reason is that the dimension reduction process in these methods may incur information loss,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Selection of appropriate collective variables for enhancing sampling of
molecular simulations remains an unsolved problem in computational biophysics.
In particular, picking initial collective variables (CVs) is particularly
challenging in higher dimensions. Which atomic coordinates or transforms there
of from a list of thousands should one pick for enhanced sampling runs? How
does a modeler even begin to pick starting coordinates for investigation? This
remains true even in the case of simple two state systems and only increases in
difficulty for multi-state systems. In this work, we solve the initial CV
problem using a data-driven approach inspired by the filed of supervised
machine learning. In particular, we show how the decision functions in
supervised machine learning (SML) algorithms can be used as initial CVs

from Logistic Regression, the outputs from deep neural network classifiers, and
other classifiers may be used to reversibly sample slow structural transitions.

"Automatically scene understanding using machine learning algorithms has been
widely applied to different industries to reduce the cost of manual labor.
Nowadays, insurance companies launch express vehicle insurance claim and
settlement by allowing customers uploading pictures taken by mobile devices.
This kind of insurance claim is treated as small claim and can be processed
either manually or automatically in a quick fashion. However, due to the
increasing amount of claims every day, system or people are likely to be fooled
by repeated claims for identical case leading to big lost to insurance
companies.Thus, an anti-fraud checking before processing the claim is
necessary. We create the first data set of car damage images collected from
internet and local parking lots. In addition, we proposed an approach to
generate robust deep features by locating the damages accurately and
efficiently in the images. The state-of-the-art real-time object detector YOLO
\cite{redmon2016you}is modified to train and discover damage region as an
important part of the pipeline. Both local and global deep features are
extracted using VGG model\cite{Simonyan14c}, which are fused later for more
robust system performance. Experiments show our approach is effective in
preventing fraud claims as well as meet the requirement to speed up the

"The proliferation of healthcare data has brought the opportunities of
applying data-driven approaches, such as machine learning methods, to assist
diagnosis. Recently, many deep learning methods have been shown with impressive
successes in predicting disease status with raw input data. However, the
""black-box"" nature of deep learning and the high-reliability requirement of
biomedical applications have created new challenges regarding the existence of
confounding factors. In this paper, with a brief argument that inappropriate
handling of confounding factors will lead to models' sub-optimal performance in
real-world applications, we present an efficient method that can remove the
influences of confounding factors such as age or gender to improve the
across-cohort prediction accuracy of neural networks. One distinct advantage of
our method is that it only requires minimal changes of the baseline model's
architecture so that it can be plugged into most of the existing neural
networks. We conduct experiments across CT-scan, MRA, and EEG brain wave with
convolutional neural networks and LSTM to verify the efficiency of our method.",After discussions of these four tasks we will introduce some analyses of the model behaviors to further validate the performance of our method 4 1 lung a de no carcinoma prediction 4 1 1 Data We construct a data set to test the model performance in classifying a de no carcinomas and healthy lungs from CT scans Our experimental data set is a composition of three data sets Data Set 1 The CT images from healthy people are collected from EL CAP Public Lung Image Database b The CT scans have obtained in a single breath hold with a 1 25 mm slice thickness that consists of 1310 DI COM images from 25 persons Data Set 2 The CT scans of diseased lungs are collected from 69 different patients by Grove et al 30 These scans are diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans being done at diagnosis and prior to surgery and slice thickness at variable from 3 to 6 mm a https g it hub com Hao han Wang CF b http www via cornell edu lung db html Data Set 3 Since these two data sets are collected differently and one of them is a collection of contrast enhanced CT scans The contrast material will likely serve as the confounding factor in prediction To correct the confounding factor We noticed a processed version c of Data Set 2 which consists of explicit labels of contrast in for mati on The data set contains 475 series from 69 different patients selected 50 with contrast and 50 without contrast Therefore we use the 1290 healthy im ages from 20 persons in Data Set 1 and,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problem
across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output,
electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise in
these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and
short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive
models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep
learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet),
to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network
(CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local
dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time
series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to
tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our
evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns,
LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several
state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are

"Data augmentation is a widely used technique in many machine learning tasks,
such as image classification, to virtually enlarge the training dataset size
and avoid overfitting. Traditional data augmentation techniques for image
classification tasks create new samples from the original training data by, for
example, flipping, distorting, adding a small amount of noise to, or cropping a
patch from an original image. In this paper, we introduce a simple but
surprisingly effective data augmentation technique for image classification
tasks. With our technique, named SamplePairing, we synthesize a new sample from
one image by overlaying another image randomly chosen from the training data
(i.e., taking an average of two images for each pixel). By using two images
randomly selected from the training set, we can generate $N^2$ new samples from
$N$ training samples. This simple data augmentation technique significantly
improved classification accuracy for all the tested datasets; for example, the
top-1 error rate was reduced from 33.5% to 29.0% for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset
with GoogLeNet and from 8.22% to 6.93% in the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also show
that our SamplePairing technique largely improved accuracy when the number of
samples in the training set was very small. Therefore, our technique is more
valuable for tasks with a limited amount of training data, such as medical
imaging tasks.",We also show the changes in training and validation losses We show the improvements in the accuracy by our Sam for IL SV RC data set in Figure 5 The losses match with ple Pairing data augmentation in Table 1 For the IL SV RC the training and validation error rates Sample Pairing sig data set as well as the full data set with 1 000 classes we n if i cant ly increases the final training loss but reduces the tested a shrink ed data set with only the first 100 classes For validation loss Without Sample Pairing we achieved the all the datasets we evaluated Sample Pairing reduced the minimum validation loss in an early stage of the training classification error rates for validation sets from 3 1 for and the validation loss gradually increased after that point SV HN up to 28 8 for the top 5 error rate of the IL SV RC With Sample Pairing we did not see such increase in the with 100 classes For training sets our Sample Pairing validation loss increased training errors for all datasets by avoiding over fitting When comparing the IL SV RC with 100 classes and Figure 6 show show our Sample Pairing data augmentation with 1 000 classes or the CI FAR 10 and CI FAR 100 the causes improvements when the number of samples available case with 100 classes CI FAR 10 has a much lower training for training is limited For this purpose we use CI FAR 10 Data Augmentation by Pairing Samples for Images Classification,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Emotions are physiological states generated in humans in reaction to internal
or external events. They are complex and studied across numerous fields
including computer science. As humans, on reading ""Why don't you ever text me!""
we can either interpret it as a sad or angry emotion and the same ambiguity
exists for machines. Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make
detecting emotions from text a challenging problem. However, as humans
increasingly communicate using text messaging applications, and digital agents
gain popularity in our society, it is essential that these digital agents are
emotion aware, and respond accordingly.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect emotions like happy, sad
or angry in textual conversations using an LSTM based Deep Learning model. Our
approach consists of semi-automated techniques to gather training data for our

"Learning linear predictors with the logistic loss---both in stochastic and
online settings---is a fundamental task in machine learning and statistics,
with direct connections to classification and boosting. Existing ""fast rates""
for this setting exhibit exponential dependence on the predictor norm, and
Hazan et al. (2014) showed that this is unfortunately unimprovable. Starting
with the simple observation that the logistic loss is $1$-mixable, we design a
new efficient improper learning algorithm for online logistic regression that
circumvents the aforementioned lower bound with a regret bound exhibiting a
doubly-exponential improvement in dependence on the predictor norm. This
provides a positive resolution to a variant of the COLT 2012 open problem of
McMahan and Streeter (2012) when improper learning is allowed. This improvement
is obtained both in the online setting and, with some extra work, in the batch
statistical setting with high probability. We also show that the improved
dependence on predictor norm is near-optimal.
  Leveraging this improved dependency on the predictor norm yields the
following applications: (a) we give algorithms for online bandit multiclass
learning with the logistic loss with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ relative mistake
bound across essentially all parameter ranges, thus providing a solution to the
COLT 2009 open problem of Abernethy and Rakhlin (2009), and (b) we give an
adaptive algorithm for online multiclass boosting with optimal sample
complexity, thus partially resolving an open problem of Beygelzimer et al.
(2015) and Jung et al. (2017). Finally, we give information-theoretic bounds on
the optimal rates for improper logistic regression with general function
classes, thereby characterizing the extent to which our improvement for linear
classes extends to other parametric and even nonparametric settings.",in the most general form possible We further present a series of new results for batch statistical learning We show how to convert our online improper Logistic Regression algorithm into a solution admitting a high probability ex ces s risk guarantee of O d log Bn n Section 5 While it is straightforward to achieve such a result in expectation using standard online to batch conversion techniques the a high probability bound is more technically challenging We achieve this using a new technique based on a modified version of the boosting the confidence scheme proposed by Mehta 2017 for exp concave losses We also prove a lower bound showing that the logarithmic dependence on B of the guarantee of our new algorithm cannot be improved Finally we show how to non constructively generalize the log B dependence on predictor norm from linear to arbitrary function classes via sequential sym me tri z ation and chaining arguments Section 6 Our general bound indicates that the extent to which dependence on the predictor range B can be improved for general classes is completely determined by their sequential metric entropy We also show how to extend this technique to the log loss where we obtain a mini max rate for general function classes that uniformly improves on the mini max log loss rates in Ra khl in and S ridha ran 2015 a,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Cilia are hairlike structures protruding from nearly every cell in the body.
Diseases known as ciliopathies, where cilia function is disrupted, can result
in a wide spectrum of disorders. However, most techniques for assessing ciliary
motion rely on manual identification and tracking of cilia; this process is
laborious and error-prone, and does not scale well. Even where automated
ciliary motion analysis tools exist, their applicability is limited. Here, we
propose an end-to-end computational machine learning pipeline that
automatically identifies regions of cilia from videos, extracts patches of
cilia, and classifies patients as exhibiting normal or abnormal ciliary motion.
In particular, we demonstrate how convolutional LSTM are able to encode complex
features while remaining sensitive enough to differentiate between a variety of
motion patterns. Our framework achieves 90% with only a few hundred training
epochs. We find that the combination of segmentation and classification

"Zero-inflated datasets, which have an excess of zero outputs, are commonly

"Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a recently-developed variation of the long
short-term memory (LSTM) unit, both of which are types of recurrent neural
network (RNN). Through empirical evidence, both models have been proven to be
effective in a wide variety of machine learning tasks such as natural language
processing (Wen et al., 2015), speech recognition (Chorowski et al., 2015), and
text classification (Yang et al., 2016). Conventionally, like most neural
networks, both of the aforementioned RNN variants employ the Softmax function
as its final output layer for its prediction, and the cross-entropy function
for computing its loss. In this paper, we present an amendment to this norm by
introducing linear support vector machine (SVM) as the replacement for Softmax
in the final output layer of a GRU model. Furthermore, the cross-entropy
function shall be replaced with a margin-based function. While there have been
similar studies (Alalshekmubarak & Smith, 2013; Tang, 2013), this proposal is
primarily intended for binary classification on intrusion detection using the

reach a training accuracy of ~63.07% and a testing accuracy of ~70.75%. In
addition, the juxtaposition of these two final output layers indicate that the

"Dark matter in the universe evolves through gravity to form a complex network
of halos, filaments, sheets and voids, that is known as the cosmic web.
Computational models of the underlying physical processes, such as classical
N-body simulations, are extremely resource intensive, as they track the action
of gravity in an expanding universe using billions of particles as tracers of
the cosmic matter distribution. Therefore, upcoming cosmology experiments will
face a computational bottleneck that may limit the exploitation of their full
scientific potential. To address this challenge, we demonstrate the application
of a machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to
learn models that can efficiently generate new, physically realistic
realizations of the cosmic web. Our training set is a small, representative
sample of 2D image snapshots from N-body simulations of size 500 and 100 Mpc.
We show that the GAN-generated samples are qualitatively and quantitatively
very similar to the originals. For the larger boxes of size 500 Mpc, it is very
difficult to distinguish them visually. The agreement of the power spectrum
$P_k$ is 1-2\% for most of the range, between $k=0.06$ and $k=0.4$. An
important advantage of generating cosmic web realizations with a GAN is the
considerable gains in terms of computation time. Each new sample generated by a
GAN takes a fraction of a second, compared to the many hours needed by
traditional N-body techniques. We anticipate that the use of generative models
such as GANs will therefore play an important role in providing extremely fast
and precise simulations of cosmic web in the era of large cosmological surveys,
such as Euclid and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).",in many fields especially for computer vision tasks such as image segmentation or object detection 24 Deep convolutional neural networks DCNN have also recently been used as data generating mechanisms Here a latent random vector typically a high dimensional Gaussian is passed through a DCNN in order to output images Generative Adversarial Networks GAN create such a model by adopting an adversarial game setting between two DCNN players a generator and a disc rim in at or The goal of the generator is to produce samples resembling the originals while the disc rim in at or aims at distinguishing the originals from the fake samples produced by the generator The training process ends when a Nash equilibrium is reached that is when no player can do better by unilaterally changing his strategy The rise of deep generative models has sparked a strong interest in the field of astronomy Deep generative models have been used to generate astronomical images of galaxies 25 27 or to recover certain features out of noisy astrophysical images 27 GANs were recently applied to generating samples of projected 2 D mass distribution called convergence 28 This approach can generate random samples of convergence maps which are consistent with the original simulated maps according to several summary statistics The projection process however washes out the complex network structures present in the dark matter distribution Here we instead focus on generating the structure of the cosmic web without projection therefore preserving the ability of the generative model to create halos filaments and sheets We accomplish our goal by synthesizing thin slices of dark matter distribution which have been pixel is ed to create 2 D images that serve as training data for a GAN model A demonstration of this method on 2 D slices presents a case for the development of 2 deep learning methods able to generate full 3 D dark matter distributions For cosmological applications it may be more efficient to work with the full 3 D matter distributions generated by a GAN rather then 2 D convergence maps For gravitational lensing the convergence map depends on the input distribution of background galaxies see 29 for review the 3 D matter distribution is projected on to the sky plane by integrating the mass in radial direction against a lensing kernel which depends on distribution n z of redshift s z of background galaxies For most lensing studies the uncertainty on n z is large and is effectively marginal is ed over If the 3 D distributions are simulated then the projection can be done analytically for a given n z 30 31 For a 2 D generative model a separate GAN would have to be trained for each n z distribution This may be particularly important for analyses beyond the power spectrum such as peak statistics 16 32 33 or deep learning 34 35 which use simulations to predict both the signal and its uncertainty In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of GAN based methods for capturing the type of matter distributions characteristic for in N body simulations As the development of 3 D generative methods for N body data is likely to be a very challenging due to s cal ability issues and memory requirements we consider this to be an important step in asserting that this approach is worth pursuing further In learning the cosmic web structures which are more feature rich than projected con ver gence maps we encountered and addressed several important challenges The first was to handle data with very large dynamic range of the data the density in the images created from slices of N body simulations span several orders of magnitude Secondly we explored how mode collapse a feature of GANs causing the model to focuses on a single local minimum affects the quality of results 36 38 As mode collapse is expected to depend on the degree of homogeneity between samples we tested the performance of GANs for both large and small cosmological volumes of size 500 and 100 Mpc the matter density distributions in large boxes are considerably more homogeneous than in small boxes Finally expanding on the work of 28 we additionally evaluate the cross correlations of the GAN generated data with itself and the training set A high cross correlation would be an indication of lack of independence between the generated samples a feature which we would judge to be undesirable in this task The paper is organised as follows In Section 2 we describe the Generative Adversarial Networks Section 3 contains the information on N body simulations used Our implement a tion of the algorithm is described in Section 4 and diagnostics used to evaluate its performance are detailed in Section 5 We present the results in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Clinical prognostic models derived from largescale healthcare data can inform
critical diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. To enable off-theshelf usage of
machine learning (ML) in prognostic research, we developed AUTOPROGNOSIS: a
system for automating the design of predictive modeling pipelines tailored for
clinical prognosis. AUTOPROGNOSIS optimizes ensembles of pipeline
configurations efficiently using a novel batched Bayesian optimization (BO)
algorithm that learns a low-dimensional decomposition of the pipelines
high-dimensional hyperparameter space in concurrence with the BO procedure.
This is achieved by modeling the pipelines performances as a black-box function
with a Gaussian process prior, and modeling the similarities between the
pipelines baseline algorithms via a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet
prior. Meta-learning is used to warmstart BO with external data from similar
patient cohorts by calibrating the priors using an algorithm that mimics the
empirical Bayes method. The system automatically explains its predictions by
presenting the clinicians with logical association rules that link patients
features to predicted risk strata. We demonstrate the utility of AUTOPROGNOSIS
using 10 major patient cohorts representing various aspects of cardiovascular
patient care.",SEER cancer registries which cover approximately 28 of the US population Yoo Coughlin 2018 We pre dic t cardiac deaths inpatients diagnosed with breast cancer SEER I colorectal cancer SEER II Leukemia SEER III respiratory cancers SEER IV digestive system can cer SEER V and urinary system cancer SEER VI The first three groups of datasets colored in red were col lect ed for cohorts of patients diagnosed with or at risk for cardiac diseases and so they shared a set of meta features including a large number of cardiac risk factors low c en Figure 4 The learned kernel decomposition for MAG GIC s or ingrate and moderate class imbalance The last group of datasets colored in blue was collected for cohorts of cancer patients for whom cardiac diseases are potential co 5 3 The Interpreter morbid i ties These datasets shared a different set of meta features including a small number of cardiac risk factors Albeit accurate models built by AUTO PROGNOSIS would high censoring rate and severe class imbalance Our ex per generally be hard for a clinician to interpret To address im ents will demonstrate the ability of AUTO PROGNOSIS to this issue AUTO PROGNOSIS deploys an interpreter module adapt its modeling choices to these different clinical setups see Figure 2 that takes as an input the learned model for 1 All algorithms were allowed to run for a maximum of 10 hours to ensure a fair comparison Automated Clinical Prognostic Modeling via Bayesian Optimization MAG GIC UK Bio bank UNO S I UNO S II SEER I SEER II SEER III SEER IV SEER V SEER VI AUTO PROGNOSIS vanilla 0 76 004 0 71 004 0 78 002 0 65 001 0 68 002 0 66 005 0 61 001 0 69 002 0 64 002 0 65 003 best predictor Grad Boost XG Boost AdaBoost Rand Forest Cox PH Cox PH S Forest Cox PH S Forest Cox PH ensembles 0 77 002 0 73 003 0 80 001 0 66 001 0 68 002 0 67 003 0 62 001 0 69 002 0 66 002 0 65 002 meta learning 0 77 004 0 72 004 0 79 002 0 65 002 0 72 003 0 68 003 0 64 001 0 71 003 0 69 003 0 66 002 full fledged 0 78 004 0 74 003 0 81 001 0 66 001 0 73 003 0 69 003 0 64 001 0 72 002 0 70 003 0 67 002 AUTO SK LEARN 0 76 003 0 72 004 0 77 002 0 63 002 0 67 002 0 51 005 0 60 001 0 65 004 0 64 002 0 61 003 AUTO WE KA 0 75 003 0 72 005 0 78 001 0 62 002 0 66 002 0 54 004 0 59 002 0 68 003 0 63 004 0 63 002 T POT 0 74 006 0 68 005 0 72 003 0 61 003 0 64 003 0 59 003 0 57 002 0 67 004 0 62 005 0 61 003 Clinical Score 0 70 007 0 70 003 0 62 001 0 56 001 Cox PH 0 75 005 0 71 0 002 0 70 001 0 59 001 0 71 003 0 65 004 0 62 002 0 72 003 0 68 003 0 67 002 Table 2 Performance of the different prognostic models in terms of the A UC ROC with 5 fold cross validation Bold numbers corre s pond to the best result The best predictor row lists the prediction algorithms picked by vanilla AUTO PROGNOSIS a given cohort in addition to a set of actionable risk strata 5 4 Learning to Pick the Right Model and R and outputs an explanation for its predictions in terms AUTO PROGNOSIS as a Clairvoyant of a set of logical association rules of the form We split up Table 2 into 2 groups of columns group 1 left contains cohorts obtained from cardiology studies whereas group 2 right contains cohorts obtained from cancer stud ies with cardiac secondary outcomes As mentioned ear C C C r r R 10,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"High-dimensional settings, where the data dimension ($d$) far exceeds the
number of observations ($n$), are common in many statistical and machine
learning applications. Methods based on $\ell_1$-relaxation, such as Lasso, are
very popular for sparse recovery in these settings. Restricted Eigenvalue (RE)
condition is among the weakest, and hence the most general, condition in
literature imposed on the Gram matrix that guarantees nice statistical
properties for the Lasso estimator. It is natural to ask: what families of
matrices satisfy the RE condition? Following a line of work in this area, we
construct a new broad ensemble of dependent random design matrices that have an
explicit RE bound. Our construction starts with a fixed (deterministic) matrix
$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ satisfying a simple stable rank condition, and
we show that a matrix drawn from the distribution $X \Phi^\top \Phi$, where
$\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ is a subgaussian random matrix, with high
probability, satisfies the RE condition. This construction allows incorporating
a fixed matrix that has an easily {\em verifiable} condition into the design
process, and allows for generation of {\em compressed} design matrices that
have a lower storage requirement than a standard design matrix. We give two
applications of this construction to sparse linear regression problems,
including one to a compressed sparse regression setting where the regression
algorithm only has access to a compressed representation of a fixed design
matrix $X$.",have established RE bounds for random matrices with sub gaussian rows and non trivial co variance structure as well as random matrices with independent rows and uniformly bounded entries Recent papers Siva kumar et al 2015 Oliveira 2016 Le cu and Mendelson 2017 have developed variants of these bounds under different moment or tail assumptions The closest relation to our work is the result by Rude lson and Zhou 2013 who showed that for a deterministic matrix X satisfying theRE condition the matrix X satisfies theRE condition too with a weaker RE parameter where the rows of are isotropic random vectors Note that unlike this result we have a simple polynomial time check able stable rank condition on our deterministic matrix X Applications to Sparse Linear Regression Lasso is the most widely studied scheme for sparse Linear Regression There has been a large and rapidly growing body of literature for Lasso and its variants which include theoretical explorations of its behavior and computationally efficient procedures for solving it We refer the reader to the recent book by Has tie et al 2015 for a detailed survey about developments here For applications of our REbound to sparse Linear Regression we draw on this rich literature studying theoretical properties of Lasso Zhou et al 2009 considered sparse Linear Regression in a setting where the co variate matrix X is pre multiplied by a Gaussian random projection matrix to generate a reduced set of new data points in d dimensions They provide a convergence analysis of the Lasso estimator built from this compressed data set This setting is however different from ours as we consider reducing the dimensionality of each co variate vector In a high dimensional setting with d cid 29 n reducing the dimensionality seems intuitively the more desirable way of achieving compression A recent area of research is that of distributed sparse Linear Regression where the data set is assumed to the distributed across multiple machines Lee et al 2015 showed that if the data is not too distributed and for the random design case average of individual Lasso estimators properly de biased converges to cid 63 at almost the same rate as the centralized Lasso estimator We are not aware of a direct connection between this work and our setting 1 2 Preliminaries Notation We denote n 1 n For a set S d Sco denotes its complement set Vectors are in column wise fashion denoted by boldface letters For a vector v v cid 62 denotes its transpose cid 107 v cid 107 it s p cid 96 norm and supp v its support Weu see Rd to denote the standard basis vector with j then try set to p j,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Automatic phylogenetic inference plays an increasingly important role in
computational historical linguistics. Most pertinent work is currently based on
expert cognate judgments. This limits the scope of this approach to a small
number of well-studied language families. We used machine learning techniques
to compile data suitable for phylogenetic inference from the ASJP database, a
collection of almost 7,000 phonetically transcribed word lists over 40
concepts, covering two third of the extant world-wide linguistic diversity.
First, we estimated Pointwise Mutual Information scores between sound classes
using weighted sequence alignment and general-purpose optimization. From this
we computed a dissimilarity matrix over all ASJP word lists. This matrix is
suitable for distance-based phylogenetic inference. Second, we applied cognate
clustering to the ASJP data, using supervised training of an SVM classifier on
expert cognacy judgments. Third, we defined two types of binary characters,
based on automatically inferred cognate classes and on sound-class occurrences.
Several tests are reported demonstrating the suitability of these characters

"The predictive quality of machine learning models is typically measured in
terms of their (approximate) expected prediction error or the so-called Area
Under the Curve (AUC) for a particular data distribution. However, when the
models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization, surrogate
functions such as the logistic loss are optimized instead. This is done because
the empirical approximations of the expected error and AUC functions are
nonconvex and nonsmooth, and more importantly have zero derivative almost
everywhere. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, and
under the assumption that the data has normal distribution, the expected error
and the expected AUC are not only smooth, but have closed form expressions,
which depend on the first and second moments of the normal distribution. Hence,
we derive derivatives of these two functions and use these derivatives in an
optimization algorithm to directly optimize the expected error and the AUC. In
the case of real data sets, the derivatives can be approximated using empirical
moments. We show that even when data is not normally distributed, computed
derivatives are sufficiently useful to render an efficient optimization method
and high quality solutions. Thus, we propose a gradient-based optimization
method for direct optimization of the prediction error and AUC. Moreover, the
per-iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm has no dependence on the
size of the data set, unlike those for optimizing logistic regression and all

"Multi-view sequential learning is a fundamental problem in machine learning
dealing with multi-view sequences. In a multi-view sequence, there exists two
forms of interactions between different views: view-specific interactions and
cross-view interactions. In this paper, we present a new neural architecture

explicitly accounts for both interactions in a neural architecture and
continuously models them through time. The first component of the MFN is called
the System of LSTMs, where view-specific interactions are learned in isolation
through assigning an LSTM function to each view. The cross-view interactions
are then identified using a special attention mechanism called the Delta-memory
Attention Network (DMAN) and summarized through time with a Multi-view Gated
Memory. Through extensive experimentation, MFN is compared to various proposed
approaches for multi-view sequential learning on multiple publicly available

"Computer vision is experiencing an AI renaissance, in which machine learning
models are expediting important breakthroughs in academic research and
commercial applications. Effectively training these models, however, is not
trivial due in part to hyperparameters: user-configured values that control a
model's ability to learn from data. Existing hyperparameter optimization
methods are highly parallel but make no effort to balance the search across
heterogeneous hardware or to prioritize searching high-impact spaces. In this
paper, we introduce a framework for massively Scalable Hardware-Aware
Distributed Hyperparameter Optimization (SHADHO). Our framework calculates the
relative complexity of each search space and monitors performance on the
learning task over all trials. These metrics are then used as heuristics to
assign hyperparameters to distributed workers based on their hardware. We first
demonstrate that our framework achieves double the throughput of a standard
distributed hyperparameter optimization framework by optimizing SVM for MNIST
using 150 distributed workers. We then conduct model search with SHADHO over

"Convolutional Neural Networks has been implemented in many complex machine

"Despite the great developments in information technology, particularly the
Internet, computer networks, global information exchange, and its positive

intrusion detection systems (IDS). IDS is a set of software and/or hardware
techniques used to detect hacker's activities in computer systems. Two types of
anomalies are used in IDS to detect intrusive activities different from normal

improve the performance of these systems. The importance of IDS is to identify
unauthorized access attempting to compromise confidentiality, integrity or

"Traffic flow forecasting, especially the short-term case, is an important
topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper does a lot of
research on network-scale modeling and forecasting of short-term traffic flows.
Firstly, we propose the concepts of single-link and multi-link models of
traffic flow forecasting. Secondly, we construct four prediction models by
combining the two models with single-task learning and multi-task learning. The
combination of the multi-link model and multi-task learning not only improves
the experimental efficiency but also the prediction accuracy. Moreover, a new
multi-link single-task approach that combines graphical lasso (GL) with neural
network (NN) is proposed. GL provides a general methodology for solving
problems involving lots of variables. Using L1 regularization, GL builds a
sparse graphical model making use of the sparse inverse covariance matrix. In
addition, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a classic regression algorithm
in Bayesian machine learning. Although there is wide research on GPR, there are
few applications of GPR in traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, we apply
GPR to traffic flow forecasting and show its potential. Through sufficient

"Cross-validation is one of the most popular model selection methods in
statistics and machine learning. Despite its wide applicability, traditional
cross validation methods tend to select overfitting models, due to the
ignorance of the uncertainty in the testing sample. We develop a new,
statistically principled inference tool based on cross-validation that takes
into account the uncertainty in the testing sample. This new method outputs a
set of highly competitive candidate models containing the best one with
guaranteed probability. As a consequence, our method can achieve consistent
variable selection in a classical linear regression setting, for which existing
cross-validation methods require unconventional split ratios. When used for
regularizing tuning parameter selection, the method can provide a further
trade-off between prediction accuracy and model interpretability. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in several simulated and
real data examples.",in much less accurate model fitting It has been observed in the literature that cross validation over fits when it fails to take into account the uncertainty in the testing sample In particular over fitting occurs if a smaller average test error comes as a result of the random sampling of testing data instead of a truly superior fit To take into account the testing sample uncertainty and fix the issue of over fitting we develop a hypothesis testing framework for cross validation which we call cross validation with confidence CVC For each candidate model m CVC tests the null hypothesis that the regression functions estimated from model m have the smallest predictive risk among all fitted candidate models and calculates a p value by comparing the cross validated residuals of all candidate models The subset of candidate models for which the null hypotheses are not rejected is a confidence set for model selection Depending on the context cross validation and hence CVC can be used for different purposes Here we focus on two most common contexts of cross validation model selection and tuning parameter selection for risk minimization Model selection Model selection is concerned with finding the true model or the one closest to the truth from a given set of candidate models Here the set of candidate models is usually discrete and fixed beforehand For example the candidate set may consist of all subsets of a given collection of co variate s or all polynomials less than a certain degree A classical and well studied problem in the cross validation literature is consistent variable selection in Linear Regression Even in the low dimensional case cross validation with a conventional split ratio is known to be inconsistent 26 36 35 We show that the smallest model in the confidence set output by CVC can achieve consistent variable selection even with a conventional split ratio Tuning parameter selection and risk minimization In many learning problems the algorithm is indexed by a regular iz ation parameter Such a tuning parameter can either be continuous such as the in the Lasso or discrete such as the number of steps in forward stepwise selection The tuning parameter selection problem is concerned with finding the tuning parameter value from a given finite candidate set that leads to the smallest predictive risk Under this context cross validation essentially finds the tuning parameter value whose fitted models have small validated predictive risk We show that i if all the tests in the CVC procedure are conducted at type I error level for some 0 1 then the confidence set contains the best fitted model with probability at least 1 and ii with high probability the confidence set only contains fitted models that are highly competitive The main challenge of the testing problem is the high correlation and vastly different scaling between the cross validated residuals Our test uses some recent,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

evaluations, for example, to warm start the BO procedure. We develop a multiple

"While deep neural networks have been shown in recent years to outperform
other machine learning methods in a wide range of applications, one of the
biggest challenges with enabling deep neural networks for widespread deployment
on edge devices such as mobile and other consumer devices is high computational
and memory requirements. Recently, there has been greater exploration into
small deep neural network architectures that are more suitable for edge
devices, with one of the most popular architectures being SqueezeNet, with an
incredibly small model size of 4.8MB. Taking further advantage of the notion
that many applications of machine learning on edge devices are often

utility of combining architectural modifications and an evolutionary synthesis
strategy for synthesizing even smaller deep neural architectures based on the
more recent SqueezeNet v1.1 macroarchitecture for applications with fewer
target classes. In particular, architectural modifications are first made to
SqueezeNet v1.1 to accommodate for a 10-class ImageNet-10 dataset, and then an
evolutionary synthesis strategy is leveraged to synthesize more efficient deep
neural networks based on this modified macroarchitecture. The resulting
SquishedNets possess model sizes ranging from 2.4MB to 0.95MB (~5.17X smaller
than SqueezeNet v1.1, or 253X smaller than AlexNet). Furthermore, the
SquishedNets are still able to achieve accuracies ranging from 81.2% to 77%,
and able to process at speeds of 156 images/sec to as much as 256 images/sec on

"This study investigates the performance of two open source intrusion

computational resources. Snort had higher detection accuracy and was thus
selected for further experiments. It was observed that the Snort triggered a
high rate of false positive alarms. To solve this problem a Snort adaptive

"The Gaussian kernel is a very popular kernel function used in many machine learning algorithms, especially in support vector machines (SVMs).

"In this project, we aimed to improve the runtime of Minisat, a
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solver that solves the Propositional
Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. We first used a logistic regression model
to predict the satisfiability of propositional boolean formulae after fixing
the values of a certain fraction of the variables in each formula. We then
applied the logistic model and added a preprocessing period to Minisat to
determine the preferable initial value (either true or false) of each boolean
variable using a Monte-Carlo approach. Concretely, for each Monte-Carlo trial,
we fixed the values of a certain ratio of randomly selected variables, and
calculated the confidence that the resulting sub-formula is satisfiable with
our logistic regression model. The initial value of each variable was set based
on the mean confidence scores of the trials that started from the literals of
that variable. We were particularly interested in setting the initial values of
the backbone variables correctly, which are variables that have the same value
in all solutions of a SAT formula. Our Monte-Carlo method was able to set 78%
of the backbones correctly. Excluding the preprocessing time, compared with the
default setting of Minisat, the runtime of Minisat for satisfiable formulae
decreased by 23%. However, our method did not outperform vanilla Minisat in
runtime, as the decrease in the conflicts was outweighed by the long runtime of
the preprocessing period.",AND CONTRIBUTIONS Table 1 We refer the reader to 4 for the definitions As shown by Table 2 our regression model achieved an of features 4 10 accuracy of 70 in predicting satisfiability when n was 0 and an accuracy of 78 when n was set to 4 The best performance of the Monte Carlo method was obtained when n was set to 4 On average it set 78 of the backbones correctly a conjunction of clauses where each clause is the d is jun c Compared with the default setting of Minis at which al tion of variables or their negations A 3 C NF formula is ways sets the branching variable to false our method yielded one in which each clause contains exactly three variables or an average decrease in conflicts of 23 and outperformed de their negations for example x 1 x 2 x 4 x 2 x 3 fault Minis at in terms of conflicts in 55 of the test cases x 4 x 1 x 3 x 4 There is a well known polynomial However it did not outperform vanilla Minis at in runtime time procedure for converting arbitrary S AT formulae into as the decrease in the conflicts was outweighed by the long 3 C NF form 3 so this restriction in clause length does not runtime of the preprocessing period compromise generality We created the training data for our learning model by 5,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Development systems for deep learning (DL), such as Theano, Torch, TensorFlow, or MXNet, are easy-to-use tools for creating complex neural network models. Since gradient computations are automatically baked in, and execution is mapped to high performance hardware, these models can be trained end-to-end on large amounts of data. However, it is currently not easy to implement many basic machine learning primitives in these systems (such as Gaussian processes, least squares estimation, principal components analysis, Kalman smoothing), mainly because they lack efficient support of linear algebra primitives as differentiable operators. We detail how a number of matrix decompositions (Cholesky, LQ, symmetric eigen) can be implemented as differentiable operators. We have implemented these primitives in MXNet, running on CPU and GPU in single and double precision. We sketch use cases of these new operators, learning Gaussian process and Bayesian linear regression models, where we demonstrate very substantial reductions in implementation complexity and running time compared to previous codes. Our MXNet extension allows end-to-end learning of hybrid models, which combine deep neural networks (DNNs) with Bayesian concepts, with applications in advanced Gaussian process models, scalable Bayesian optimization, and Bayesian active learning.",are provided A number of backward expressions for linear algebra are given in 8 among them the one we use for the symmetric ei gen decomposition

serious implementations on top of standard libraries like BLAS and LA PACK 2 1 Software Here we summarize the current implementations of linear algebra operators in commonly used D LDS We concentrate

in terms of runtime and memory The Tensor Flow implementation is not optimized for in place computations and a substantial number of temporary matrices are used It is unclear whether this is due to the dependence on Ei gen or could be fixed Results of runtime comparisons between Tensor Flow and our MX Net implementation are given in Section 6 1 for a number of operators both on CPU and GPU Our

just discussed We demonstrate how our operators in MX Net are used to learn Gaussian Process models in Sections 3 1 and 3 2 Moreover we benchmark a number of advanced models in Section 6 combining sparse GP and D NN concepts in a common computation graph Since typical GP applications operate with large dense matrices it is crucial to avoid unnecessary temporary copies and a careful in place implementation such as ours should be advantageous In summary while some differentiable linear algebra operators are implemented in the most popular D LDS the support is patchy at best with the exception of Tensor Flow which provides a broad coverage surpass ing our contribution at present In general operators are implemented at a high level reducing to Ei gen Tensor Flow or Num Py Sci Py The a no which may not take full advantage of the underlying execution context GPU CPU Also not much care is taken to avoid temporary copies In contrast we implement our operators into the MX Net core calling tuned BLAS LA PACK libraries directly Most of our operators are implemented in place so that no additional memory is required While this is somewhat more difficult to do see Section 5 it should payoff in applications such as those in Section 3 where rather large matrices are operated on 2 2 Goals Our work of extending MX Net with differentiable linear algebra operators is motivated by the following broader goals Transfer key advantages of D LDS to other ML or scientific computation systems The main advantages of D LDS are support of high performance compute platforms GPUs multi threaded CPUs and au to mated gradients by reverse mode differentiation Frequently used non DL machine learning packages for Gaussian Processes or approximate Bayesian inference lack these advantages Current major efforts of hardware and software developers to speed up DL can be leveraged for non DL systems if missing capabilities are added to D LDS as differentiable operators High memory efficiency ML applications such as Gaussian Processes or approximate Bayesian inference are often memory bound and good existing codes contain careful memory management If integrated into D LDS these memory saving tricks have to be retained Our lina lg implementation carefully leverages in place support of underlying BLAS and LA PACK routines improving on previous work Enable end to end learning of hybrids between neural networks and Bayesian machine learning While deep neural networks are easy to construct can be trained very efficiently and learn more useful feature representations from large datasets than previous efforts Bayesian methodology such as Gaussian Processes requires less labeled data and works better for automated decision making e g active learning Bayesian optimization While combinations can improve on either 23 previous work requires implementation efforts out of scope of most users 2 Examples in Section 3 and Section 6 demonstrate that hybrid implementations can

"Bayesian optimization (BO) is a global optimization strategy designed to find
the minimum of an expensive black-box function, typically defined on a compact
subset of $\mathcal{R}^d$, by using a Gaussian process (GP) as a surrogate
model for the objective. Although currently available acquisition functions
address this goal with different degree of success, an over-exploration effect
of the contour of the search space is typically observed. However, in problems
like the configuration of machine learning algorithms, the function domain is
conservatively large and with a high probability the global minimum does not
sit on the boundary of the domain. We propose a method to incorporate this
knowledge into the search process by adding virtual derivative observations in
the \gp at the boundary of the search space. We use the properties of GPs to
impose conditions on the partial derivatives of the objective. The method is
applicable with any acquisition function, it is easy to use and consistently
reduces the number of evaluations required to optimize the objective
irrespective of the acquisition used. We illustrate the benefits of our
approach in an extensive experimental comparison.",show that performances of D BO and AD BO are better than or equal to the performance of V BO It can also be seen that the variance of the optimization performance between different optimization runs is smaller for D BO and AD BOth an for V BO mu minim V BO D BO AD BO Fig 6 Same as in Figure 4 but with M ND functions that have local minimum on the edge of the search space 4 4 Case Study 3 Sig opt Function Library A benchmark function library 3 Sig opt is developed fore val u a ting BO algorithms 14 When taking into account only three dimensional non discrete functions without local border minima the library outputs 14 functions As in the prev i o us case study to mimic real use cases the function ob ser vat ions are corrupted with additive Gaussian noise y x g x N 0 0 1 25 50 and 75 percentiles of found mini mum values of these functions as a function of iterations are illustrated in Figure 5 The results are similar as for M ND functions D BO and AD BO still perform better than V BO Simi la rly as before the variance of the optimization performance between different optimization runs is notably smaller forD BO than for V BO AD BO performs similarly as V BO Since there are less functions per dimension the overall variability in the results is bigger and the percentile curves are not as smooth 4 5 Case Study 4 Simple Gaussian Functions With Min im a on the Border The algorithms are used to find minimum of similar Gaussian functions as in Section 4 3 with the difference that the global minima of each function is exactly on the border of the search space The purpose of this case study is to show what hap pens to the performance of the proposed method if the a priori assumption is violated 25 50 and 75 percentiles of found min i mum values of these functions as a function of iterations are illustrated in Figure 6 As expected the results show that D BO does not perform as well as V BO and AD BO Interestingly D BO performs almost as well as V BO which shows the robustness of the proposed approach and makes it an appropriate default choice in most problems 4 6 Case Study 5 Hyper parameter Optimization of RMS prop To show the performance for real data the proposed algorithm was used to tune hyper parameters of the RMS prop algorithm 4 that used in training a neural network for CI FAR 10 data 5 All 3 Function library available at https g it hub com sig opt e val set 4 RMS prop is an unpublished but established gradient descend method pro posed by Geoff Hinton in http www cs toronto edu ti j men csc 321 slides lecture slides lec 6 pdf 5 Data set available at https www cs toronto edu kri z ci far html 0 50 0 45 0 40,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Current remote sensing image classification problems have to deal with an
unprecedented amount of heterogeneous and complex data sources. Upcoming
missions will soon provide large data streams that will make land cover/use
classification difficult. Machine learning classifiers can help at this, and
many methods are currently available. A popular kernel classifier is the
Gaussian process classifier (GPC), since it approaches the classification
problem with a solid probabilistic treatment, thus yielding confidence
intervals for the predictions as well as very competitive results to
state-of-the-art neural networks and support vector machines. However, its
computational cost is prohibitive for large scale applications, and constitutes
the main obstacle precluding wide adoption. This paper tackles this problem by
introducing two novel efficient methodologies for Gaussian Process (GP)
classification. We first include the standard random Fourier features
approximation into GPC, which largely decreases its computational cost and
permits large scale remote sensing image classification. In addition, we
propose a model which avoids randomly sampling a number of Fourier frequencies,
and alternatively learns the optimal ones within a variational Bayes approach.
The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in complex problems of

"In this paper, we propose and evaluate the application of unsupervised
machine learning to anomaly detection for a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). We
compare two methods: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) adapted to time series data
generated by a CPS, and one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods
are evaluated against data from the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, a
scaled-down but fully operational raw water purification plant. For both
methods, we first train detectors using a log generated by SWaT operating under
normal conditions. Then, we evaluate the performance of both methods using a
log generated by SWaT operating under 36 different attack scenarios. We find
that our DNN generates fewer false positives than our one-class SVM while our
SVM detects slightly more anomalies. Overall, our DNN has a slightly better F
measure than our SVM. We discuss the characteristics of the DNN and one-class
SVM used in this experiment, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of
the two methods.",we choose a D NN with 100 dimensions of intermediate layers which is trained with 58 epochs the maximal in our experiment for the evaluation By using a sufficient amount of held out data we can tune the hyper parameters without using data that contains anomalies possibly leading to test and thus generalization errors This is desirable because for most realistic situations we do not have data with real anomalies and simulated anomalies may not represent real anomalies However in this experiment we do not use held out data to test the accuracy of trained DN Ns because we deem

"Domain mismatch between training and testing can lead to significant
degradation in performance in many machine learning scenarios. Unfortunately,
this is not a rare situation for automatic speech recognition deployments in
real-world applications. Research on robust speech recognition can be regarded
as trying to overcome this domain mismatch issue. In this paper, we address the
unsupervised domain adaptation problem for robust speech recognition, where
both source and target domain speech are presented, but word transcripts are
only available for the source domain speech. We present novel
augmentation-based methods that transform speech in a way that does not change
the transcripts. Specifically, we first train a variational autoencoder on both
source and target domain data (without supervision) to learn a latent
representation of speech. We then transform nuisance attributes of speech that
are irrelevant to recognition by modifying the latent representations, in order
to augment labeled training data with additional data whose distribution is
more similar to the target domain. The proposed method is evaluated on the
CHiME-4 dataset and reduces the absolute word error rate (WER) by as much as
35% compared to the non-adapted baseline.",reported in 19 Aurora 4 is a broad training procedures as well as the same language models are used band corpus designed for noisy speech recognition tasks based on for all the experiments For the CHiME 4 data set besides reporting WS J 0 as well Two microphone types clean channel are included the WER on the clean and the noisy development sets respectively and six noise types are artificially added to both microphone types we also show the WER for the noisy set by the four recording lo which results in four conditions clean A channel B noisy C cations bus BUS cafe CAF pedestrian area PED and street and channel noisy D We use the clean training set as the labeled junction STR All the CHiME 4 results are listed in Table 1 For source domain data and the multi condition development set as the the Aurora 4 data set we report the averaged WER as well as the unlabeled target domain data The multi condition test e val 92 set is WER in four conditions in Table 2 Different sets of experiments are used for evaluation separated by double horizontal lines and indexed by the Exp Index Setting WER WER in Noisy Condition by Type Exp Index Aug Method Fold Clean Noisy BUS CAF PED STR Orig 1 19 04 87 80 96 16 92 35 78 46 84 24,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In recent years, the number of papers on Alzheimer's disease classification
has increased dramatically, generating interesting methodological ideas on the
use machine learning and feature extraction methods. However, practical impact
is much more limited and, eventually, one could not tell which of these
approaches are the most efficient. While over 90\% of these works make use of
ADNI an objective comparison between approaches is impossible due to variations
in the subjects included, image pre-processing, performance metrics and
cross-validation procedures. In this paper, we propose a framework for
reproducible classification experiments using multimodal MRI and PET data from
ADNI. The core components are: 1) code to automatically convert the full ADNI
database into BIDS format; 2) a modular architecture based on Nipype in order
to easily plug-in different classification and feature extraction tools; 3)
feature extraction pipelines for MRI and PET data; 4) baseline classification
approaches for unimodal and multimodal features. This provides a flexible
framework for benchmarking different feature extraction and classification
tools in a reproducible manner. We demonstrate its use on all (1519) baseline
T1 MR images and all (1102) baseline FDG PET images from ADNI 1, GO and 2 with
SPM-based feature extraction pipelines and three different classification
techniques (linear SVM, anatomically regularized SVM and multiple kernel
learning SVM). The highest accuracies achieved were: 91% for AD vs CN, 83% for
MCIc vs CN, 75% for MCIc vs MCInc, 94% for AD-A$\beta$+ vs CN-A$\beta$- and 72%
for MCIc-A$\beta$+ vs MCInc-A$\beta$+. The code is publicly available at

"Deep Learning has recently become hugely popular in machine learning,
providing significant improvements in classification accuracy in the presence
of highly-structured and large databases.
  Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning.
Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being
processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users'
private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions,
interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive
information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem,
collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties
locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the
parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private.
Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy (DP) to make
information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and
Shmatikov at CCS'15.
  Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep
learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In
particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep
learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training
sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time
nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted
training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are
intended to come from the same distribution as the training data).
Interestingly, we show that record-level DP applied to the shared parameters of
the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP
is not designed to address our attack).",obtained when running model in version 9 2 1 Experiments on M NIST Instead of using two labels per attack MIA and a generative adversarial network DCGAN user

"Source localization in ocean acoustics is posed as a machine learning problem
in which data-driven methods learn source ranges directly from observed
acoustic data. The pressure received by a vertical linear array is preprocessed
by constructing a normalized sample covariance matrix (SCM) and used as the

support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF)) are investigated in this
paper, with focus on the FNN. The range estimation problem is solved both as a
classification problem and as a regression problem by these three machine

"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in image-based plant
phenotyping, applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to tackle
challenging problems, such as leaf segmentation (a multi-instance problem) and
counting. Most of these algorithms need labelled data to learn a model for the
task at hand. Despite the recent release of a few plant phenotyping datasets,
large annotated plant image datasets for the purpose of training deep learning
algorithms are lacking. One common approach to alleviate the lack of training
data is dataset augmentation. Herein, we propose an alternative solution to
dataset augmentation for plant phenotyping, creating artificial images of
plants using generative neural networks. We propose the Arabidopsis Rosette
Image Generator (through) Adversarial Network: a deep convolutional network
that is able to generate synthetic rosette-shaped plants, inspired by DCGAN (a
recent adversarial network model using convolutional layers). Specifically, we
trained the network using A1, A2, and A4 of the CVPPP 2017 LCC dataset,
containing Arabidopsis Thaliana plants. We show that our model is able to
generate realistic 128x128 colour images of plants. We train our network
conditioning on leaf count, such that it is possible to generate plants with a
given number of leaves suitable, among others, for training regression based
models. We propose a new Ax dataset of artificial plants images, obtained by
our ARIGAN. We evaluate this new dataset using a state-of-the-art leaf counting
algorithm, showing that the testing error is reduced when Ax is used as part of
the training data.",is Deep can learn those parameters from data Recently several gen Convolutional GAN 21 The benefits of this model mostly erat ive models were proposed to generate realistic images

a large project implementing a wide variety of machine learning algorithms,
from standard techniques such as decision trees and logistic regression to
modern techniques such as deep neural networks as well as other
recently-published cutting-edge techniques not found in any other library.
mlpack is quite fast, with benchmarks showing mlpack outperforming other

"Incorporating additional knowledge in the learning process can be beneficial
for several computer vision and machine learning tasks. Whether privileged
information originates from a source domain that is adapted to a target domain,
or as additional features available at training time only, using such
privileged (i.e., auxiliary) information is of high importance as it improves
the recognition performance and generalization. However, both primary and
privileged information are rarely derived from the same distribution, which
poses an additional challenge to the recognition task. To address these
challenges, we present a novel learning paradigm that leverages privileged
information in a domain adaptation setup to perform visual recognition tasks.
The proposed framework, named Adaptive SVM+, combines the advantages of both
the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm and the domain
adaptation framework, which are naturally embedded in the objective function of
a regular SVM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the publicly
available Animals with Attributes and INTERACT datasets and report
state-of-the-art results in both of them.",which correspond to in al space while at the same time utilizing privileged in the area under the precision recall curve The train test split formation to

"Intrusion detection has attracted a considerable interest from researchers

"Most of previous machine learning algorithms are proposed based on the i.i.d.
hypothesis. However, this ideal assumption is often violated in real
applications, where selection bias may arise between training and testing
process. Moreover, in many scenarios, the testing data is not even available
during the training process, which makes the traditional methods like transfer
learning infeasible due to their need on prior of test distribution. Therefore,
how to address the agnostic selection bias for robust model learning is of
paramount importance for both academic research and real applications. In this
paper, under the assumption that causal relationships among variables are
robust across domains, we incorporate causal technique into predictive modeling
and propose a novel Causally Regularized Logistic Regression (CRLR) algorithm
by jointly optimize global confounder balancing and weighted logistic
regression. Global confounder balancing helps to identify causal features,
whose causal effect on outcome are stable across domains, then performing
logistic regression on those causal features constructs a robust predictive
model against the agnostic bias. To validate the effectiveness of our CRLR
algorithm, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real
world datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that our CRLR
algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and the interpretability of
our method can be fully depicted by the feature visualization.",From Table 2 we can see that our CR LR algorithm per forms the best at most of settings showing the robustness of our al gori th m even when there is no explicit distribution or domain shift relative F 1 improvement and the category bias level are correlated Another interesting observation is that the advantage of our al go to some degree The extreme cases are more obvious For example rit hm is more obvious when we have less training samples in the dog category is most biased where our CR LR s relative improve source domain For example the Amazon data set is much larger ment in F 1 can reach about 50 In contrast the bias in the church th anD SLR data set and the advantage of our algorithm over the category is not obvious which can account for CR LR s ordinary best baseline in d a scenario is more obvious than that in a d performance in church category in Table 1 scenario This coincides with our intuition that selection bias and A notable merit of introducing causality into predictive tasks is non i i d problems often happens when we do not have sufficient to make the predictive models more explain able To demonstrate training samples and our algorithm is able to perform robust pre the interpret ability of our method we visualize the top 5 features diction in these scenarios in each category selected by CR LR and LR respectively Due to LR LR L 1 SVM Two Step MLP CR LR a w 0 845 0 886 0 858 0 844 0 885 0 897 a d 0 837 0 885 0 858 0 858 0 869 0 887 w a 0 787 0 884 0 856 0 826 0 889 0 900 w d 0 821 0 901 0 892 0 865 0 890 0 887 d a 0 710 0 877 0 856 0 802 0 873 0 900 d w 0 789 0 897 0 880 0 817 0 896 0 898 a c 0 846 0 885 0 857 0 850 0 874 0 895 w c 0 791 0 875 0 843 0 807 0 875 0 896 d c 0 738 0 871 0 855 0 782 0 885 0 897 c a 0 853 0 904 0 895 0 896 0 899 0 901 c w 0 859 0 896 0 887 0 886 0 888 0 898 c d 0 841 0 896 0 886 0 885 0 889 0 887 mean 0 810 0 888 0 869 0 843 0 884 0 895 Table 2 Average accuracy on data set bias a d w c denote the four different domains Amazon DSL R Webcam and Caltech respectively 4 6 Experiments on We Chat Ads Data set shift induced by selection bias while correlation based methods In this experiment we simulate the distribution discrepancy of test are highly unreliable in such situations We also note the uns at is ing and training data by separating users into different group sac factory performance of two step method This demonstrates the cording to their age Specifically we split the data set into 4 sub importance of jointly optimizing causal inference and predictive sets by users age including A e 20 30 A e 30 40 A e modeling 40 50 A e 50 100 And we train the baselines and CR LR on users A e 20 30 and test them on all four groups,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Linear regression is one of the most prevalent techniques in machine
learning, however, it is also common to use linear regression for its
\emph{explanatory} capabilities rather than label prediction. Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) is often used in statistics to establish a correlation between an
attribute (e.g. gender) and a label (e.g. income) in the presence of other
(potentially correlated) features. OLS assumes a particular model that randomly
generates the data, and derives \emph{$t$-values} --- representing the
likelihood of each real value to be the true correlation. Using $t$-values, OLS
can release a \emph{confidence interval}, which is an interval on the reals
that is likely to contain the true correlation, and when this interval does not
intersect the origin, we can \emph{reject the null hypothesis} as it is likely
that the true correlation is non-zero. Our work aims at achieving similar
guarantees on data under differentially private estimators. First, we show that
for well-spread data, the Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform (JLT) gives
a very good approximation of $t$-values, secondly, when JLT approximates Ridge
regression (linear regression with $l_2$-regularization) we derive, under
certain conditions, confidence intervals using the projected data, lastly, we
derive, under different conditions, confidence intervals for the ""Analyze

"This paper describes our solution for the video recognition task of
ActivityNet Kinetics challenge that ranked the 1st place. Most of existing
state-of-the-art video recognition approaches are in favor of an end-to-end
pipeline. One exception is the framework of DevNet. The merit of DevNet is that
they first use the video data to learn a network (i.e. fine-tuning or training
from scratch). Instead of directly using the end-to-end classification scores
(e.g. softmax scores), they extract the features from the learned network and
then fed them into the off-the-shelf machine learning models to conduct video
classification. However, the effectiveness of this line work has long-term been
ignored and underestimated. In this submission, we extensively use this
strategy. Particularly, we investigate four temporal modeling approaches using
the learned features: Multi-group Shifting Attention Network, Temporal Xception

"This paper describes an implementation of the L-BFGS method designed to deal with two adversarial situations. The first occurs in distributed computing environments where some of the computational nodes devoted to the evaluation of the function and gradient are unable to return results on time. A similar challenge occurs in a multi-batch approach in which the data points used to compute function and gradients are purposely changed at each iteration to accelerate the learning process. Difficulties arise because L-BFGS employs gradient differences to update the Hessian approximations, and when these gradients are computed using different data points the updating process can be unstable. This paper shows how to perform stable quasi-Newton updating in the multi-batch setting, studies the convergence properties for both convex and nonconvex functions, and illustrates the behavior of the algorithm in a distributed computing platform on binary classification logistic regression and neural network training problems that arise in machine learning.",on time i e in the presence of faults This amounts to using different data points to evaluate the function and gradient at the beginning and the end of the iteration which can be harmful to quasi Newton methods since they employ gradient differences to update Hessian approximations A similar challenge occurs in a multi batch approach in which the data points used to compute the function and gradient are purposely changed at each iteration or every several iterations to accelerate the learning process The main objective of this paper is to show that stable quasi Newton updating can be achieved in these settings without incurring extra computational cost or special synchronization The key is to perform quasi Newton updating based on the overlap between consecutive batches The only restriction is that this overlap should not be insignificant something that can be expected or easily enforced in most situations Recently several stochastic quasi Newton SQ N methods have been proposed see e g 5 12 19 21 31 38 52 69 74 The methods enumerated above differ in three major aspects i the update rules for the curvature correction pairs and the Hessian approx imation ii the frequency of updating and iii the required extra computational cost and synchronization required Our method is different from these methods predominantly due to the fact that it does not modify the BF GS update equations or the form of the curvature pairs and does not require extra gradient computations Additionally our method is designed to work in a distributed settings with faults in which faults occur randomly and sample consistency cannot be assumed and as such several SQ N methods are not suitable We analyze the convergence properties of the multi batch L BF GS method using a fixed step length strategy as well as a diminishing step length strategy on both strongly convex and non convex problems This is appropriate in our setting as using a fixed step,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Multi-label classification is a practical yet challenging task in machine
learning related fields, since it requires the prediction of more than one
label category for each input instance. We propose a novel deep neural networks
(DNN) based model, Canonical Correlated AutoEncoder (C2AE), for solving this
task. Aiming at better relating feature and label domain data for improved
classification, we uniquely perform joint feature and label embedding by
deriving a deep latent space, followed by the introduction of label-correlation
sensitive loss function for recovering the predicted label outputs. Our C2AE is
achieved by integrating the DNN architectures of canonical correlation analysis
and autoencoder, which allows end-to-end learning and prediction with the
ability to exploit label dependency. Moreover, our C2AE can be easily extended
to address the learning problem with missing labels. Our experiments on

"The goal of this tutorial is to introduce key models, algorithms, and open
questions related to the use of optimization methods for solving problems
arising in machine learning. It is written with an INFORMS audience in mind,
specifically those readers who are familiar with the basics of optimization
algorithms, but less familiar with machine learning. We begin by deriving a
formulation of a supervised learning problem and show how it leads to various
optimization problems, depending on the context and underlying assumptions. We
then discuss some of the distinctive features of these optimization problems,
focusing on the examples of logistic regression and the training of deep neural
networks. The latter half of the tutorial focuses on optimization algorithms,
first for convex logistic regression, for which we discuss the use of
first-order methods, the stochastic gradient method, variance reducing
stochastic methods, and second-order methods. Finally, we discuss how these
approaches can be employed to the training of deep neural networks, emphasizing
the difficulties that arise from the complex, nonconvex structure of these
models.",let us ignore regular iz ation terms and recall that our ultimate goal is to solve 7 with some accuracy cid 15 This means that we want to obtain w such that f w f w cid 15 cid 15 cid 15 where w is the optimal solution to 7 Instead however we solve problem 8 to some accuracy cid 15 obtaining w such that E f w f w cid 15 where w is the optimal solution cid 15 cid 15 to 8 If we use w as our approximate solution to 7 then from 9 and 10 and since cid 15 E f w f w 0 we have with probability at least 1 that E f w f w E f w f w E f w f w cid 15 cid 15 cid 15 cid 15 E f w f w E f w f w cid 115 C log 1 O cid 15 17 n Thus to achieve expected cid 15 optimal it y with respect to 7 while balancing the contributions of the terms on the right hand side of 17 we should aim to have say cid 115 C log 1 cid 15 cid 15 O and cid 15 18 n 2 2 We can now compare algorithms by quantifying the computational costs they require to satisfy these bounds For example suppose that we apply some algorithm to solve problem 8 where for a given n the cost of obtaining w satisfying the latter bound in 18 is c n cid 15 cid 15 which increases with both n and 1 cid 15 For a fixed family of functions p w with w W and complexity C obtaining the former bound in 18 requires n O cid 15 2 ignoring log factors Considering now the optimization algorithm and its cost c n cid 15 it is clear that any algorithm that computes f its gradient or its Hessian at any point has a cost of at least O n O 1 cid 15 2 to perform a single iteration regardless of the rate at which it converges to a minimize r of f This is the case e g for the gradient descent method SGD on the other hand has a per iteration cost that is independent of n and can be shown to converge to an cid 15 optimal,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Noisy data, non-convex objectives, model misspecification, and numerical
instability can all cause undesired behaviors in machine learning systems. As a
result, detecting actual implementation errors can be extremely difficult. We
demonstrate a methodology in which developers use an interactive proof
assistant to both implement their system and to state a formal theorem defining
what it means for their system to be correct. The process of proving this
theorem interactively in the proof assistant exposes all implementation errors
since any error in the program would cause the proof to fail. As a case study,
we implement a new system, Certigrad, for optimizing over stochastic
computation graphs, and we generate a formal (i.e. machine-checkable) proof
that the gradients sampled by the system are unbiased estimates of the true

"In spite of the advances in pattern recognition technology, Handwritten
Bangla Character Recognition (HBCR) (such as alpha-numeric and special

To improve the performance of Handwritten Bangla Digit Recognition (HBDR), we

Bangla digit recognition techniques based on Deep Belief Network (DBN),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CNN with dropout, CNN with dropout and
Gaussian filters, and CNN with dropout and Gabor filters. These networks have
the advantage of extracting and using feature information, improving the
recognition of two dimensional shapes with a high degree of invariance to
translation, scaling and other pattern distortions. We systematically evaluated
the performance of our method on publicly available Bangla numeral image

"Near-data processing (NDP) refers to augmenting memory or storage with
processing power. Despite its potential for acceleration computing and reducing
power requirements, only limited progress has been made in popularizing NDP for
various reasons. Recently, two major changes have occurred that have ignited
renewed interest and caused a resurgence of NDP. The first is the success of
machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for
training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the
popularity of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore
processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. In this
paper, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that
allows us to simulate instorage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform
(named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD
that can execute various ML algorithms using data stored in the SSD. To conduct
a thorough performance analysis and an in-depth comparison with alternative
techniques, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient descent
(SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable models such
as logistic regression and neural networks. We implement and compare three SGD
variants (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML,
exploiting the multiple NAND channels to parallelize SGD. In addition, we
compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing,
revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations
identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future
research on ISP for accelerating ML.",and propose our implementation of a specific algorithm in this paper the future research directions stochastic gradient descent SGD algorithm which is the de facto standard for training differentiable models such as II BACKGROUND Logistic Regression and deep neural networks Specifically A Machine Learning as an Optimization Problem we implement three types of parallel SGD synchronous SGD 19 Downpour SGD 20 and elastic averaging SGD Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that EA SGD 21 We compare the performance of these parallel aims to provide computers with the ability to learn without SGD implementations using a 10 times amplified version of being programmed explicitly 23 Depending on the type M NIST 22 Furthermore to evaluate the effectiveness of ISP of feedback available for training we can broadly classify based optimization by SGD we compare the performance of machine learning tasks into three categories 24 supervised ISP based optimization and conventional in host processing learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning I HP based optimization To facilitate further explanation we briefly review the To the best of the authors knowledge this work is one of basic formulation of supervised learning focusing only on the the first attempts to apply NDP to a multi channel SSD for ac materials directly relevant to the present work More in depth ce le rating SGD based optimization for training differentiable reviews of machine learning can be found in 25 27 models Our specific contributions include the following For various types of machine learning algorithms the core concept can often be explained using the following e qua We created a full fledged ISP supporting SSD platform t ions 25 called ISP ML which required a multi year team effort ISP ML is versatile and can simulate not only storage F D L D r 1 related functionalities of a multi channel SSD but also D F D 2 NDP related functionalities in a realistic manner ISP ML D 3 can execute various machine learning algorithms using t 1 t the data stored in the SSD while supporting the simulation where D and denote the input data and model parameters of multi channel N AND flash S SDs to exploit data level also known as weights respectively and a loss function parallelism L D reflects the difference between the optimal and cur We thoroughly tested the effectiveness of our platform by rent hypotheses A regular iz ation term to mitigate the over implementing and comparing multiple versions of parallel fitting problem is denoted by r and the objective function SGD which is widely used for training various machine F D is the sum of the loss and regular iz ation terms The learning algorithms We also devised a methodology that main purpose of supervised machine learning can then be can carefully and fairly compare the performance of I HP formulated as finding the optimal that minimizes F D based and ISP based optimization The method of batch gradient descent 26 is a first order We identified intriguing future research opportunities to iterative optimization algorithm to find the minimum value of exploit the parallelism provided by the multiple N AND F D by updating in every iteration t in the direction channels inside S SDs As in high performance com put of the negative gradient of F D where is the learning ing multiple nodes i e N AND channel controllers rate In each iteration of the gradient descent optimization the exist for sharing workloads but unlike in conventional value of the parameter is updated as follows parallel computing the communication cost is negligible due to the negligible latency of on chip communication t 1 t F D t 4 Using our platform we envision new designs of parallel cid 88 F D 5 t i t optimization and training algorithms that can exploit this,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"A growing number of threats to Android phones creates challenges for malware
detection. Manually labeling the samples into benign or different malicious
families requires tremendous human efforts, while it is comparably easy and
cheap to obtain a large amount of unlabeled APKs from various sources.
Moreover, the fast-paced evolution of Android malware continuously generates
derivative malware families. These families often contain new signatures, which
can escape detection when using static analysis. These practical challenges can
also cause traditional supervised machine learning algorithms to degrade in
performance.
  In this paper, we propose a framework that uses model-based semi-supervised
(MBSS) classification scheme on the dynamic Android API call logs. The
semi-supervised approach efficiently uses the labeled and unlabeled APKs to
estimate a finite mixture model of Gaussian distributions via conditional
expectation-maximization and efficiently detects malwares during out-of-sample
testing. We compare MBSS with the popular malware detection classifiers such as
support vector machine (SVM), $k$-nearest neighbor (kNN) and linear
discriminant analysis (LDA). Under the ideal classification setting, MBSS has
competitive performance with 98\% accuracy and very low false positive rate for
in-sample classification. For out-of-sample testing, the out-of-sample test
data exhibit similar behavior of retrieving phone information and sending to
the network, compared with in-sample training set. When this similarity is
strong, MBSS and SVM with linear kernel maintain 90\% detection rate while
$k$NN and LDA suffer great performance degradation. When this similarity is
slightly weaker, all classifiers degrade in performance, but MBSS still
performs significantly better than other classifiers.",We compare MBS S with some of the most popular malware class if i ers support vector machine k nearest neighbor and linear discriminant analysis

set A class i fieri strained on the training set and expected to perform well when tested on the test set Cross validation is usually em ploy ed to assess the performance of a class i fier In sample classification provides the ideal classification scenario where test data distribution is the same as the training data distribution Our next set of experiments focuses on out of sample testing An out of sample experiment uses the class i fier trained and validated on the in sample data and predicts the labels of incoming unlabeled data The vast majority of the unlabeled data are not guaranteed to follow the same distribution as the in sample training data This is a challenge for machine learning algorithms used for practical applications We consider a class i fier robust and practical when it can still achieve reasonably well performance for out of sample classification All the A PK s for our experiments are retrieved from Virus Total and the experiments are conducted in R 39 41 29 5 1 Data set We use the dynamic logs obtained from our Android emulator as described in Section 3 The behavior data contains the filtered API calls during the execution of runs The set of unique API calls

PK is represented by x 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 d where 1 denotes the existence of an API call and 0 otherwise 5 2 In sample validation We first demonstrate that for in sample classification MBS S has

dynamic code loading behavior and sending the information to outside network The label distribution is 43 57 and the chance accuracy classification accuracy when randomly guessing is 0 57 We first validate the effectiveness of all five class if i ers We conduct 10 fold cross validation report the accuracy mean by averaging the ac curacies and calculate the standard deviation of the ac curacies

scenario SVM with radial and linear kernels demonstrate the best performance with ac curacies at 98 8 and 98 6 respectively and false positive rates both at 2 3 NN and MBS S have similar performance

data set consisting of all malicious samples and thus our task is to detect the malicious samples We report the detection rate DR which is defined by the number of correctly cl as s if i ed malware A PK s divided by the total number of out of sample test data After validating that these class if i ers have high accuracy and low false positive in Section 5 2 we use them to test on incoming samples Under this practical and realistic scenario the test samples do not follow very similar distribution as the training samples In this case the class if i ers with high accuracy degrade sometimes even significantly for out of sample testing Recall that the in sample malicious behaviors include retrieving phone in for mati on and sending to the network Here we divide the out of sample ex peri ment s into two types First a strong similarity of this malicious behavior from the test set which indicates that the distribution of the test set is similar to the distribution of a subset in the training

"Research on automated image enhancement has gained momentum in recent years,
partially due to the need for easy-to-use tools for enhancing pictures captured
by ubiquitous cameras on mobile devices. Many of the existing leading methods
employ machine-learning-based techniques, by which some enhancement parameters
for a given image are found by relating the image to the training images with
known enhancement parameters. While knowing the structure of the parameter
space can facilitate search for the optimal solution, none of the existing
methods has explicitly modeled and learned that structure. This paper presents
an end-to-end, novel joint regression and ranking approach to model the
interaction between desired enhancement parameters and images to be processed,
employing a Gaussian process (GP). GP allows searching for ideal parameters
using only the image features. The model naturally leads to a ranking technique
for comparing images in the induced feature space. Comparative evaluation using
the ground-truth based on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset plus subjective tests on
an additional data-set were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.",each grid we calculate its saturation value by taking the against twin Gaussian processes T GP 3 T GP is as tru mean values of those image blocks in the HSV color space tu red prediction method which considers correlation be We also calculate RMS contrast on that grid These act as tween both input and output to produce predictions Though localized features of 144 D each We finally append the a low RMS E between ground truth and predicted para me image parameters which are average saturation value and ter s does not guarantee that the enhancement will be vis u RMS contrast Appending the image parameters allows GP ally appealing unless the RM SEt ends to zero it gives us to express the parameters of the enhanced counterparts as a a confirmation that the prediction is lying near the ground function of both the low quality parameters and its feature truth in the parameter space Also this experiment validates vector We finally get a 867 D 432 3 144 3 the effectiveness of the GP regress or representation for every image Second experiment is a qualitative measure of the image quality produced by the proposed and the competing al go 3 7 Implementation Details and Efficiency rit hms KNN Picasa and 25 The metric of L 2 error in the GPs are known to be computationally intensive They L ab space was adopted in 25 We believe that it is a poor take about O N 3 time for training where N are the num indicator of the enhancement quality and instead opt for Vi ber of training examples The matrix in version of ANN N su al Information Fidelity V IF metric 21 This metric has matrix and the computation of the derivative of the ker the ability to predict whether the visual quality of the other nel are the bottlenecks in the GP training procedure We image has been enhanced in comparison with the reference train aGP model using about 1200 low quality images and image by producing a value greater than one This is unlike six counterparts per image in about 18 hours on an Intel other quality metrics such as S SIM 24 F SIM 28 VS I Xeon cid 64 2 4 GHz 16 The computational efficiency can 27 etc We use the publicly available implementation of be improved by using GP regression techniques proposed V IF 5 We calculate the V IF between the proposed enhance for large data 8 1 or using efficient data structures such ment reference image and the enhancement by 1 KNN ask d trees 22 During testing our approach is extremely 2 Picasa and 3 the approach of 25 other image Thus fast We tested it on two systems Intel Xeon and a modern V IF 1 implies that the proposed enhancement is better desktop system with Intel i 7 cid 64 3 7 GHz It can predict all than the one produced by the competing algorithm and vice the three parameters for 3150 and 1287 images per second versa This comparison is done for 60 pairs where 15 im using Intel Xeon and i 7 systems respectively A built in ages each are enhanced using Picasa and 25 whereas the KNN search function processes only 224 images per sec remaining 30 images are enhanced using KNN approach on d when asked to find one nearest neighbor in 5000 image Third experiment is aimed towards evaluating the ef fec data seton the Intel Xeon system All the implementations ti ve ness of GP ranking For each image we generate only are done in MAT LAB Since our approach need not query 32 enhanced versions Our GP ranker selects the highest the training database it could be portable and potentially al ranked image out of those 32 and presents it to the user low for enhancements being performed on mobile devices The highest ranked image is supposed to have the best qu al it y We compute the V IF metric between the best image 4 Data sets and Experimental Setup selected by the ranker reference image and the other 31 images other images Ideally for all these 31 images we In this section we present describe the data and ex per should get values less than one indicating that GP ranker i mental setup Results of these experiments are presented in the Section 5 We perform four kinds of experiments 5 available at live ece u texas edu research quality has indeed selected the best image 600 36 3 4 9 Proposed Approach We also carryout a subjective evaluation test to assess if d 500 Competing Approach e people prefer the enhanced counterparts generated by our n i a 400 approach We compare our approach against three other tb,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"A fall is an abnormal activity that occurs rarely, so it is hard to collect
real data for falls. It is, therefore, difficult to use supervised learning
methods to automatically detect falls. Another challenge in using machine
learning methods to automatically detect falls is the choice of engineered
features. In this paper, we propose to use an ensemble of autoencoders to
extract features from different channels of wearable sensor data trained only
on normal activities. We show that the traditional approach of choosing a
threshold as the maximum of the reconstruction error on the training normal
data is not the right way to identify unseen falls. We propose two methods for
automatic tightening of reconstruction error from only the normal activities
for better identification of unseen falls. We present our results on two
activity recognition datasets and show the efficacy of our proposed method
against traditional autoencoder models and two standard one-class
classification methods.",of each A E is combined to arrive upon a final decision Typically while using A E the maximum of reconstruction error on the training set is considered as the threshold to identify an activity as abnormal However we experimentally show that such threshold may not be appropriate for detecting falls due to noisy sensor data We present two threshold tightening techniques to remove few outliers from the normal data Then either a new threshold is derived using inter quart ile range or by training a new A E on the training data with outliers removed We show result on two activity recognition datasets that contain different normal activities along with falls from wearable sensors The rest of the paper is organized as follows In the next Section we present a brief introduction to Auto encoders Section 3 reviews the literature on fall detection using A E and on the use of A E in general outlier detection tasks We present the proposed channel wise Ensemble of Autoencoder and two threshold tightening approaches using reconstruction error in Section 5 Experimental analysis and results are discussed in Section 6 followed by conclusions and future work in Section 7,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Recently, several algorithms for symbolic regression (SR) emerged which
employ a form of multiple linear regression (LR) to produce generalized linear
models. The use of LR allows the algorithms to create models with relatively
small error right from the beginning of the search; such algorithms are thus
claimed to be (sometimes by orders of magnitude) faster than SR algorithms
based on vanilla genetic programming. However, a systematic comparison of these
algorithms on a common set of problems is still missing. In this paper we
conceptually and experimentally compare several representatives of such
algorithms (GPTIPS, FFX, and EFS). They are applied as off-the-shelf,
ready-to-use techniques, mostly using their default settings. The methods are
compared on several synthetic and real-world SR benchmark problems. Their
performance is also related to the performance of three conventional machine
learning algorithms --- multiple regression, random forests and support vector

"Yield curve forecasting is an important problem in finance. In this work we
explore the use of Gaussian Processes in conjunction with a dynamic modeling

Processes have been successfully applied to model functional data in a variety
of applications. A Gaussian Process is used to model the yield curve. The
hyper-parameters of the Gaussian Process model are updated as the algorithm
receives yield curve data. Yield curve data is typically available as a time
series with a frequency of one day. We compare existing methods to forecast the
yield curve with the proposed method. The results of this study showed that
while a competing method (a multivariate time series method) performed well in
forecasting the yields at the short term structure region of the yield curve,
Gaussian Processes perform well in the medium and long term structure regions
of the yield curve. Accuracy in the long term structure region of the yield
curve has important practical implications. The Gaussian Process framework
yields uncertainty and probability estimates directly in contrast to other
competing methods. Analysts are frequently interested in this information. In

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for
constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not
require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure;
they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to
harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers.
Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view
of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse
set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a
mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of
algorithms for learning in implicit generative models--models that only specify
a stochastic procedure with which to generate data--and relate these ideas to
modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate
Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and
highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative
models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs,
and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to
the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for
density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to
distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence
minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature,
and we synthesise these views to form an understanding in terms of the
relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for
future exploration and cross-pollination.",By using an inferential principle driven by hypothesis test ing we have been able to develop a number of indirect methods for learning the parameters of generative models These methods do not compute the probability of the data or posterior distributions over latent variables but instead only involve relative statements of probability by com par ing

"Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is widely used in speech recognition. In order
to achieve higher prediction accuracy, machine learning scientists have built

"Machine learning has been gaining traction in recent years to meet the demand

"Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as
semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models
have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts,
allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed
by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very
accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the
categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such
understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to
individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently
developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear
classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and
adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words.
Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall
classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from
text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We
further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based
document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these
document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show
that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of
classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability
which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for
other applications.",We first describe the data set experimental setup training procedure and classification accuracy of our ML models We will consider four ML models three CNN s with different filter sizes and a BoW SVM class i fier Then we demonstrate that L RP can be used to identify relevant words in text documents We compare heat maps for the best performing CNN model and the BoW SVM class i fier and report the most representative words for three exemplary document categories These results demonstrate qualitatively that the CNN model produces better explanations than the BoW SVM class i fier After that we move to the evaluation of the document summary vectors where we show that a 2 D PCA projection of the document vectors computed from the L RP scores groups documents according to their topics without requiring the true labels Since worse results are obtained when using the S A scores or the uniform orT F IDF weighting this indicates that the explanations produced by L RP are semantically more meaningful than the latter Finally we confirm quantitatively the observations made before namely that 1 the L RP decomposition method provides better explanations than S A and that 2 the CNN model outperforms the BoW SVM class i fier in terms of explanatory power 5 1 Experimental Setup 5 1 1 Data set For our experiments we consider a topic categorization task and employ the freely available 20 News groups 1 data set consisting of newsgroup posts evenly distributed among twenty fine grained categories More precisely we use the 20 news by date version which is already partitioned into 11314 training and,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict
chronological age in healthy people and deviations from healthy brain ageing

further establish the credentials of ""brain-predicted age"" as a biomarker of
individual differences in the brain ageing process, using a predictive
modelling approach based on deep learning, and specifically convolutional
neural networks (CNN), and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted
MRI data. Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted
age using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to
establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic
and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined the test-retest and
multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples
(within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN brain-predicted ages were
generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, on all
datasets. Input data were grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps
generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data. Brain-predicted
age represents an accurate, highly reliable and genetically-valid phenotype,
that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age

"Population growth and increasing droughts are creating unprecedented strain
on the continued availability of water resources. Since irrigation is a major
consumer of fresh water, wastage of resources in this sector could have strong
consequences. To address this issue, irrigation water management and prediction
techniques need to be employed effectively and should be able to account for
the variabilities present in the environment. The different techniques surveyed
in this paper can be classified into two categories: computational and
statistical. Computational methods deal with scientific correlations between
physical parameters whereas statistical methods involve specific prediction
algorithms that can be used to automate the process of irrigation water
prediction. These algorithms interpret semantic relationships between the
various parameters of temperature, pressure, evapotranspiration etc. and store
them as numerical precomputed entities specific to the conditions and the area
used as the data for the training corpus used to train it. We focus on
reviewing the computational methods used to determine Evapotranspiration and
its implications. We compare the efficiencies of different data mining and
machine learning methods implemented in this area, such as Logistic Regression,
Decision Tress Classifier, SysFor, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Fuzzy Logic
techniques, Artifical Neural Networks(ANNs) and various hybrids of Genetic
Algorithms (GA) applied to irrigation prediction. We also recommend a possible

"Gradients have been used to quantify feature importance in machine learning
models. Unfortunately, in nonlinear deep networks, not only individual neurons
but also the whole network can saturate, and as a result an important input
feature can have a tiny gradient. We study various networks, and observe that
this phenomena is indeed widespread, across many inputs.
  We propose to examine interior gradients, which are gradients of
counterfactual inputs constructed by scaling down the original input. We apply
our method to the GoogleNet architecture for object recognition in images, as
well as a ligand-based virtual screening network with categorical features and
an LSTM based language model for the Penn Treebank dataset. We visualize how
interior gradients better capture feature importance. Furthermore, interior
gradients are applicable to a wide variety of deep networks, and have the
attribution property that the feature importance scores sum to the the
prediction score.
  Best of all, interior gradients can be computed just as easily as gradients.
In contrast, previous methods are complex to implement, which hinders practical
adoption.",Faith fullness A natural question is to ask why gradients of counter factual s obtained by scaling the input capture feature importance for the original image First from studying the visualization s in Figure 4 the results look reasonable in that the highlighted pixels capture features representative of the predicted class as a human would perceive them Second we confirmed that the network too seems to find these features representative by performing abl at ions It is somewhat natural to expect that the Inception network is robust to to changes in input intensity presumably there are some low brightness images in the training set However these counter factual s seem reasonable even for networks where such scaling does not cor respond to a natural concept like intensity and when the counter factual s fall outside the training set for instance in the case of the ligand based virtual screening network see Section 3 1 We speculate that the reason why these counter factual s make sense is because the network is built by composing ReL Us As one scales the input starting from a suitable baseline various neurons activate and the scaling process that does a somewhat thorough job of exploring all these events that contribute to the prediction for the input There is an analogous argument for other operator such as max pool average pool and soft max here the triggering events arent discrete but the argument is analogous,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Safeguarding privacy in machine learning is highly desirable, especially in
collaborative studies across many organizations. Privacy-preserving distributed
machine learning (based on cryptography) is popular to solve the problem.
However, existing cryptographic protocols still incur excess computational
overhead. Here, we make a novel observation that this is partially due to naive
adoption of mainstream numerical optimization (e.g., Newton method) and failing
to tailor for secure computing. This work presents a contrasting perspective:
customizing numerical optimization specifically for secure settings. We propose
a seemingly less-favorable optimization method that can in fact significantly
accelerate privacy-preserving logistic regression. Leveraging this new method,
we propose two new secure protocols for conducting logistic regression in a
privacy-preserving and distributed manner. Extensive theoretical and empirical
evaluations prove the competitive performance of our two secure proposals while
without compromising accuracy or privacy: with speedup up to 2.3x and 8.1x,
respectively, over state-of-the-art; and even faster as data scales up. Such
drastic speedup is on top of and in addition to performance improvements from
existing (and future) state-of-the-art cryptography. Our work provides a new

"A main focus of machine learning research has been improving the
generalization accuracy and efficiency of prediction models. Many models such
as SVM, random forest, and deep neural nets have been proposed and achieved
great success. However, what emerges as missing in many applications is
actionability, i.e., the ability to turn prediction results into actions. For
example, in applications such as customer relationship management, clinical
prediction, and advertisement, the users need not only accurate prediction, but
also actionable instructions which can transfer an input to a desirable goal
(e.g., higher profit repays, lower morbidity rates, higher ads hit rates).
Existing effort in deriving such actionable knowledge is few and limited to
simple action models which restricted to only change one attribute for each
action. The dilemma is that in many real applications those action models are
often more complex and harder to extract an optimal solution.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach that achieves actionability by
combining learning with planning, two core areas of AI. In particular, we
propose a framework to extract actionable knowledge from random forest, one of
the most widely used and best off-the-shelf classifiers. We formulate the
actionability problem to a sub-optimal action planning (SOAP) problem, which is
to find a plan to alter certain features of a given input so that the random
forest would yield a desirable output, while minimizing the total costs of
actions. Technically, the SOAP problem is formulated in the SAS+ planning
formalism, and solved using a Max-SAT based approach. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on a
personal credit dataset and other benchmarks. Our work represents a new
application of automated planning on an emerging and challenging machine
learning paradigm.",into actions For example in applications such as customer relationship management clinical prediction and advertisement the users need not only accurate prediction but also actionable instructions which can transfer an input to a desirable goal e g higher profit repays lower morbidity rates higher ads hit rates Existing effort in deriving such actionable knowledge is few and limited to simple action models which re strict ed to only change one attribute for each action The dilemma is that in many real applications those action models are often more complex and harder to extract an optimal solution In this paper we propose a novel approach that achieves action ability by combining learning with planning two core areas of A I In particular we propose a framework to extract actionable knowledge from random forest one of the most widely used and best off the shelf class if i ers We formulate the action ability problem to a sub optimal action planning SOAP problem which is to find a plan to alter certain features of a given input so that the random forest would yield a desirable output while minimizing the total costs of actions Technically the SOAP problem is formulated in the S AS planning formalism and solved using a Max S AT based approach Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on a personal credit data set and other benchmarks Our work represents a new application of automated planning on an emerging and challenging machine learning paradigm Keywords actionable knowledge extraction machine learning planning random forest weighted partial Max S AT,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Based on API call sequences, semantic-aware and machine learning (ML) based
malware classifiers can be built for malware detection or classification.
Previous works concentrate on crafting and extracting various features from
malware binaries, disassembled binaries or API calls via static or dynamic
analysis and resorting to ML to build classifiers. However, they tend to
involve too much feature engineering and fail to provide interpretability. We
solve these two problems with the recent advances in deep learning: 1)
RNN-based autoencoders (RNN-AEs) can automatically learn low-dimensional
representation of a malware from its raw API call sequence. 2) Multiple
decoders can be trained under different supervisions to give more information,
other than the class or family label of a malware. Inspired by the works of
document classification and automatic sentence summarization, each API call
sequence can be regarded as a sentence. In this paper, we make the first
attempt to build a multi-task malware learning model based on API call
sequences. The model consists of two decoders, one for malware classification
and one for $\emph{file access pattern}$ (FAP) generation given the API call
sequence of a malware. We base our model on the general seq2seq framework.

"Regularized empirical risk minimization (R-ERM) is an important branch of
machine learning, since it constrains the capacity of the hypothesis space and
guarantees the generalization ability of the learning algorithm. Two classic
proximal optimization algorithms, i.e., proximal stochastic gradient descent
(ProxSGD) and proximal stochastic coordinate descent (ProxSCD) have been widely
used to solve the R-ERM problem. Recently, variance reduction technique was
proposed to improve ProxSGD and ProxSCD, and the corresponding ProxSVRG and
ProxSVRCD have better convergence rate. These proximal algorithms with variance
reduction technique have also achieved great success in applications at small
and moderate scales. However, in order to solve large-scale R-ERM problems and
make more practical impacts, the parallel version of these algorithms are
sorely needed. In this paper, we propose asynchronous ProxSVRG (Async-ProxSVRG)

Async-ProxSVRG can achieve near linear speedup when the training data is
sparse, while Async-ProxSVRCD can achieve near linear speedup regardless of the

"With the constant growth of the World Wide Web and the number of documents in
different languages accordingly, the need for reliable language detection tools
has increased as well. Platforms such as Twitter with predominantly short texts
are becoming important information resources, which additionally imposes the
need for short texts language detection algorithms. In this paper, we show how
incorporating personalized user-specific information into the language
detection algorithm leads to an important improvement of detection results. To
choose the best algorithm for language detection for short text messages, we
investigate several machine learning approaches. These approaches include the
use of the well-known classifiers such as SVM and logistic regression, a
dictionary based approach, and a probabilistic model based on modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing. Furthermore, the extension of the probabilistic model to
include additional user-specific information such as evidence accumulation per
user and user interface language is explored, with the goal of improving the
classification performance. The proposed approaches are evaluated on randomly
collected Twitter data containing Latin as well as non-Latin alphabet languages
and the quality of the obtained results is compared, followed by the selection
of the best performing algorithm. This algorithm is then evaluated against two
already existing general language detection tools: Chromium Compact Language
Detector 2 (CLD2) and langid, where our method significantly outperforms the
results achieved by both of the mentioned methods. Additionally, a preview of
benefits and possible applications of having a reliable language detection

"Machine learning and statistics typically focus on building models that
capture the vast majority of the data, possibly ignoring a small subset of data
as ""noise"" or ""outliers."" By contrast, here we consider the problem of jointly
identifying a significant (but perhaps small) segment of a population in which
there is a highly sparse linear regression fit, together with the coefficients
for the linear fit. We contend that such tasks are of interest both because the
models themselves may be able to achieve better predictions in such special
cases, but also because they may aid our understanding of the data. We give
algorithms for such problems under the sup norm, when this unknown segment of
the population is described by a k-DNF condition and the regression fit is
s-sparse for constant k and s. For the variants of this problem when the
regression fit is not so sparse or using expected error, we also give a
preliminary algorithm and highlight the question as a challenge for future
work.",In this work we consider the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for the joint task of ident i f ying significant segments of a population in which a sparse model provides a good fit We are able to identify such segments when they are described by a k D NF and there is a s sparse regression fit for constant k and s More specifically we give algorithms when there is a linear relationship with respect to which the error is bounded by with probability 1 i e sup norm In this case we find a condition in which the error is bounded by for a 1 fraction of the population with probability 1 over the sample of data Theorem 1 Conditional sparse Linear Regression Suppose that D is a joint probability d is tri but ion over x 0 1 n y Rd and z R such that there is a k D NF c for which for some s sparse a Rd Pr h a yi z c x 1 1 and Pr c x 1 x y z Dh i x y z D Then given and in 0 1 0 1 2 and access to examples from D for any constants s and k there is an algorithm that runs in polynomial time in n d 1 1 and log 1 and finds an s sparse a and k D NF c such that with probability 1 Pr h a yi z c x 1 1 and Pr c x 1 1 x y z Dh i x y z D Our algorithms make crucial use of the sought solution s sparsity The key observation is that since the linear rule has constant sparsity with respect to the relevant dimensions there are a constant number of ex tre mal examples such that we can obtain low error on the unknown event by fitting these ex tre mal examples We can then use the linear rule we obtain from fitting such a set of examples to label the data according to whether or not that point has low error under the linear rule Finally this enables us to find an event on which the linear rule has low error Thus it suffices to simply perform a search over candidates for the ex tre mal examples and return one for which the corresponding event captures enough of the data We also note a trivial weak approximation algorithm for an expected error variant of the problem that does not rely on sparsity when there is a k D NF c and a linear rule a giving conditional expected error and c is true with probability we find a condition c and a linear rule a with conditional expected error O nk and probability nk We pose the design of better algorithms for the dense regression and expected error tasks as challenges for future work 1 2 Related work We are building on recent work by Juba 11 on identifying potentially rare events of interest in a distribution which captures a family of data mining tasks including e g association rule discovery 1 or bump hunting 8 This work is closely related to theoretical work on positive reliable learning 12 13 which is in turn very closely related to the heuristic learning model introduced by Pitt and Valiant 15 and studied in depth by B shout y and Burroughs 5 these are models of classification in which one type of error is minimized subject to a hard bound on the other type of error The key difference is essentially that the work by Juba like the work in data mining focuses on bounding the error conditioned on the identified event In the present work we develop this perspective further and seek to perform supervised learning in such a conditional distribution,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Online learning has become crucial to many problems in machine learning. As
more data is collected sequentially, quickly adapting to changes in the data
distribution can offer several competitive advantages such as avoiding loss of
prior knowledge and more efficient learning. However, adaptation to changes in
the data distribution (also known as covariate shift) needs to be performed
without compromising past knowledge already built in into the model to cope
with voluminous and dynamic data. In this paper, we propose an online stacked
Denoising Autoencoder whose structure is adapted through reinforcement
learning. Our algorithm forces the network to exploit and explore favourable
architectures employing an estimated utility function that maximises the
accuracy of an unseen validation sequence. Different actions, such as Pool,
Increment and Merge are available to modify the structure of the network. As we
observe through a series of experiments, our approach is more responsive,
robust, and principled than its counterparts for non-stationary as well as
stationary data distributions. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm
performs better at preserving gained prior knowledge and responding to changes

"Relational logistic regression (RLR) is a representation of conditional
probability in terms of weighted formulae for modelling multi-relational data.
In this paper, we develop a learning algorithm for RLR models. Learning an RLR
model from data consists of two steps: 1- learning the set of formulae to be
used in the model (a.k.a. structure learning) and learning the weight of each
formula (a.k.a. parameter learning). For structure learning, we deploy Schmidt
and Murphy's hierarchical assumption: first we learn a model with simple
formulae, then more complex formulae are added iteratively only if all their
sub-formulae have proven effective in previous learned models. For parameter
learning, we convert the problem into a non-relational learning problem and use
an off-the-shelf logistic regression learning algorithm from Weka, an
open-source machine learning tool, to learn the weights. We also indicate how
hidden features about the individuals can be incorporated into RLR to boost the
learning performance. We compare our learning algorithm to other structure and
parameter learning algorithms in the literature, and compare the performance of
RLR models to standard logistic regression and RDN-Boost on a modified version

Learning Twin Support Vector Machine TSVM Multiple Kernels 1 Introduction The ever increasing volume of information on the Internet has made search engines vital tools for information extraction From a theoretical point of view search engines are information retrieval tools responsible for downloading indexing processing retrieving and ranking of information 1 Malicious content on the Internet poses a unique challenge for search engines one that other information retrieval systems do not normally face Malicious content refers to deceitful information created for the purpose of manipulating a search engine s results The open nature of the Internet allows any individual to create and distribute arbitrary content Thus malicious content cannot be avoided Web pages which attempt to manipulate a search engine s results are the most important type of malicious content Such pages are called Spam Pages Other types of malicious content include spam queries spam posts and Fishing pages Most website owners want to have higher ranking pages This is because only 15 of users visit the second page of search engine results before changing their query Thus search engines are constantly trying to assign better ranks to the most relevant results This improvement increases their revenue and popularity Such attempts can be exploited and led to the creation of spam pages by profiteers 2 It should be noted that not all spam pages have commercial or exploit ive purposes The contents of these pages differ from the user s expectations They aim to penetrate ranking algorithms and therefore can be classified as spam pages The main purpose of spam pages is to fraud ranking algorithms with the aim of achieving a higher rank among the top ten search engine s results of various queries as fast as possible 3 Fig 1 illustrates a sample spam page Since the text in each page include multiple valuable keywords the content of the page is insignificant for the user From the perspective of search engine the most important effect of spam pages is diminution of search engine user s trust Furthermore the large number of spam pages forces search engines to allocate more resources bandwidth storage space software to crawling indexing storing and processing contents of these pages 1 P ag e Figure 1 An example spam page although it contains popular keywords the overall content is useless to a human user Spam pages mainly aim to corrupt ranking algorithms in search engines Ranking is done by search engine which estimates the quality of a page with respect to a particular query In other words one scores is assigned to each retrieved document Documents are sorted in decreasing or increasing order of their scores Search engines often use the following measures to rank web pages a Relevance measured as the degree of similarity between the input query and the text of the web page b Importance input query is ignored in it This measure can be calculated as the number of times other pages are linked to a certain page As mentioned earlier spam pages are created with the aim of obtaining a high rank in a search engine s results As a result they are created with the ranking algorithms in mind 1 The content of a spam page is organized to match more queries Therefore a variety of useful keywords are used so that more user queries can be matched Also web spam content are changed based on the structure of web pages Therefore content ranking algorithms assign higher scores to these pages If the goal is to match the target page to a certain request then the target keywords need to be repeated multiple times In 2006 Na j or k et al 4 presented an approach based on content analysis using examination of various features of spam and non spam pages Their findings formed a basis for identifying spam pages Creating a high number of links is another method used by spammers to improve their rank In 6 8 a different approach based on the links between pages in the web graph is used for detection The graph and patterns that emerge from it are used to differentiate spam and non spam pages There have also been attempts to combine ideas form both methods to achieve satisfactory results In 5 spam pages are detected using a combination of content based and link based methods In recent years user behavior has also been a decisive factor in detecting spam pages Liu et al 9 presented a behavior based method Modern techniques for creating spam pages include information hiding where users are encountered with different versions of pages compared to search engine crawlers Various methods of spam detection have been proposed including those based on coding style similarity 18 and language pattern analysis 11 Machine learning algorithms have also been applied to page features 12 16 The majority of methods involved in creating spam pages rely on content based techniques Thus analyzing the content features of these pages will improve much more efficiency compared to other methods Web pages have certain features that can be extracted using content analysis The values for these features are significantly different across spam and non spam pages Since the detection problem seeks to label pages as either spam or normal it can be converted to a classification problem with two classes Therefore once 2 P ag e features of page content are extracted and a suitable set of pages are labeled normal or spam a proper class i fier can be used to determine the being spam of unlabeled pages collected by a search engine Machine learning methods use classification algorithms to extract and detect patterns among normal and spam pages Using more powerful algorithms can increase the accuracy of detection In previous researches Hidden Markov Model 12 Decision Tree 13 Bayesian networks 14 and artificial neural network 15 are used to separate spam instances from non spam ones Many machine learning algorithms have been used for the binary classification problem Support Vector Machine SVM is one of these algorithms which offers favorable results SVM despite is successfully applied to many problems of differentiating positive and negative instances suitable accuracy has not been reported for web spam detection by it However studies on other applications demonstrate that new extensions of SVM have significantly superior performance 19 Such versions aim to improve its performance on different data through changes in SVM structure SVM is binary class i fier which constructs a hyper plane among instances such that the distance from the instances is maximized and thus a good separation is achieved In an extended version of it namely the Twin SVM T WSVM two separate hyper planes are used for each class instances Based on the nature of web pages and number of extracted features in them this version of SVM can be used for web spam classification In some cases samples cannot be separated linearly by their attributes The concept of kernel has been introduced in machine learning methods to solve this problem In this approach the data are first logically mapped to a higher dimensional space The new dimensions are created such that they can be linearly separated with more accuracy using hyper planes 21 In this paper TSVM with two non linear kernels is used for spam page detection The main innovation of the proposed method is embedding two different suitable kernels for each hyper plane in TSVM Experimental results on UK 2006 and UK 2007 datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting spam pages The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents a review of various extensions to the SVM The importance of using non linear kernels is considered in section 3 The details of the proposed method are discussed in section 4 Section 5 presents the experimental results Finally in section 6 the concluding remarks and suggestions for future works are offered 2 SVM Extensions Support Vector Machine SVM is a non statistical binary class i fier which has attracted a lot of attentions in recent years In this method all the instances are used in conjunction with an optimization algorithm to find instances that form the boundaries of classes Using these instances an optimal linear decision boundary is created to separate classes and it is solved using the Quadratic Programming Problem QP P 23 This class i fier does not rely on statistics the training points are directly used to determine the decision boundary between two classes Proxima l Support Vector Machine PSVM is a new version of the SVM which aims to reduce computational costs In this algorithm two parallel hyper planes rather than one are used to separate instances Generalized Eigenvalue Proxima l SVM GE PSVM uses two non parallel hyper planes each of which is placed near one of the two classes Since a large QP P must be solved the algorithm becomes very costly 3 P ag e The improved GE PSVM called Twin SVM T WSVM eliminates this problem by solving two smaller instances of QP P Therefore computational cost is decreased while the algorithm becomes more robust Then a variation of T WSVM namely the Least Square T WSVM was introduced The final solution of the algorithm is obtained by solving two linear equations rather than two QP Ps Although the algorithm is easier however it is less robust due to its sensitivity to noise Knowledge based T WSVM is another version of T WSVM which uses current instances along with previous knowledge to separate instances into two classes Compared to other knowledge based algorithms it offers less complexity time In order to improve the structure of T WSVM Smooth T WSVM was introduced The most important change in this version of the algorithm is the elimination of QP P limitations 3 Non linear Kernels Using linear models for classification is much easier and faster than non linear counterparts Linear models work on data that can be separable linearly Often developing of linear models is more appropriate than non linear ones since they are associated with lower complexity time However in some cases the instances are not intrinsically linear Such instances must be mapped to a more dimensional space where a linear model is applicable Fig 2 illustrates how the data are mapped to a new space Mapping to a high dimensional space is not always straightforward manner and can impose much more costs than primary dimension space By offering a way to reduce associated costs the idea of kernel addresses this shortcoming A kernel implicitly maps the data to a higher dimensional space In order to classify non linear data in a linear manner the SVM needs to use the idea of a kernel which leads to enhanced classification capabilities 21 Figure 2 idea of using kernel Generally in algorithms where data are in the form of dot products the idea of a kernel can be applied There are various types of kernel functions Polynomial Gaussian linear and fuzzy are more common kernel functions 21 Using kernel functions together with S VMs is lead to performance improvement of binary classification 4 Proposed Method In this paper non linear kernels in the extended SVM are used to present a binary class i fier with superior performance in detecting spam pages In the following the learning structure of the SVM is discussed in detail Next the non linear kernels in the T WSVM are introduced Finally the proposed method i e Multiple Kernel TSVM is presented As shown in section of experimental results this method improves the accuracy of detecting spam pages 4 P ag e 4 1 TSVM The TSVM was first introduced by Jaya da 22 based on the normal SVM In this algorithm instead of using a single plane and increasing its margins toward binary classification two non parallel planes are used to separate instances into two classes In this class i fier each class is determined using one of the hyper planes The procedure is demonstrated in Fig 3 Figure 3 Operation of Twin Support Vector Machine TSVM Assume that we are given a set of data containing positive and negative instances In order to separate

"DeepMind's recent spectacular success in using deep convolutional neural nets
and machine learning to build superhuman level agents --- e.g. for Atari games
via deep Q-learning and for the game of Go via Reinforcement Learning ---
raises many questions, including to what extent these methods will succeed in
other domains. In this paper we consider DQL for the game of Hex: after
supervised initialization, we use selfplay to train NeuroHex, an 11-layer CNN
that plays Hex on the 13x13 board. Hex is the classic two-player alternate-turn
stone placement game played on a rhombus of hexagonal cells in which the winner
is whomever connects their two opposing sides. Despite the large action and
state space, our system trains a Q-network capable of strong play with no
search. After two weeks of Q-learning, NeuroHex achieves win-rates of 20.4% as
first player and 2.1% as second player against a 1-second/move version of
MoHex, the current ICGA Olympiad Hex champion. Our data suggests further
improvement might be possible with more training time.",Another challenge is that the reward signal in Hex occurs only at the end of a game so with respect to move actions is infrequent meaning that most updates are based only on network evaluations without immediate win loss feedback The question is whether the learning process will allow this end of game reward information to propagate back to the middle and early game To address this challenge we use supervised mentoring training the network first to replicate the action values produced by a heuristic over a database of positions Such training is faster than RL and allows the middle and early game updates to be meaningful at the start of Q-Learning without having to rely on end of game reward propagating back from the endgame As with Alpha Go 12 we apply this heuristic only to initialize the network the reward in our Q-Learning is based only on the outcome of the game being played The main advantage of using a TD method such as Q-Learning over training based only on final game outcomes as was done with Alpha Go is data efficiency Making use of subsequent evaluations by our network allows the system to deter mine which specific actions are better or worse than expected based on previous training by observing where there is a sudden rise or fallin evaluation A system that uses only the final outcome can only know that the set of moves made by the winner should be encouraged and those made by the loser discouraged even though many of the individual moves made by the winner maybe bad and many of the individual moves made by the loser may be good We believe this differ en ce is part of what allows us to obtain promising results using less computing power than Alpha Go 1 5 Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a process that learns from actions that lead to a goal An agent learns from the environment and makes decisions Everything that the agent can interact with is called the environment The agent and environment interact continually the agent selecting actions and the environment responding to those actions and presenting new situations to the agent The environment also reports rewards numerical scalar values that the agent tries to maximize over time A complete specification of an environment defines a task which is one instance of the reinforcement learning problem Fig 2 The agent environment interaction in reinforcement learning The agent and environment interact at each discrete time step t 0 1 2 3 At each time step the agent receives some representation of the environment s state s cid 15 S where S is the set of possible states and on that basis selects an t action a cid 15 A where A is the set of actions available in state s One time t t t t step later in part as a consequence of its action the agent receives a numerical reward r cid 15 R and finds itself in a new state s t 1 t 1 The purpose or goal of the agent is formalized in terms of a special reward signal passing from the environment to the agent At each time step the reward is a scalar r cid 15 R Informally the agent s goal is to maximize the total amount of t reward it receives This means maximizing not immediate reward but cumulative reward in the long run The field of reinforcement learning is primarily the study of methods for tackling this challenge A RL agent chooses actions according to a policy a s which is a probability distribution over all possible actions for the current state The policy may be deterministic or stochastic For a given policy we define the value of a state v S as the expectation value of cumulative reward from state S if we follow cid 88 v S E t 1 r s S t 0 t 1 where is a discount factor indicating how much more to credit immediate reward than long term reward this is generally necessary to ensure reward is finite if the agent environment interaction continues indefinitely however it may be omitted if the interaction ends in bounded time for example in a game of Hex For a given problem we define the optimal policy not necessarily unique as that which produces the highest value in every state We then denote this highest achievable value as v S Note that neither v S or v S a retractable to compute in general however it is the task of a wide variety of RL algorithms to estimate them from the agent s experience Similarly we can define for any policy the action value of each state action pair q S A which analogous to v S is defined as the expectation value of cumulative reward from state S if we take action A and follow after that Similarly we can define q S A as q S A Notice that choosing the action with the highest q S A in each state is equivalent to following the optimal policy See 13 for excellent coverage of these topics and many others pertaining to RL 1 6 Deep Q-Learning Q-Learning is based on the following recursive expression called a Bellman e qua tion for q S A q s a E r max q s a s a t t t 1 t 1 t t a Note that this expression can be derived from the definition of q s a t t From this expression we formulate an update rule which allows us to iterative ly update an estimate of q S A typically written Q S A or simply Q S A from the agents stream of experience as follows Q s a r max Q s a t t t 1 t 1 a Where in the tabular case all state action pairs estimated independently would represent moving the left hand side value toward the right hand side value by some step size fraction of the total difference in the function approximation case for example using a neural network we use it to represent a gradient descent step on the left value decreasing for example the squared difference between them Since a maximization is required if the network for Q were formulated as a map directly from state action pairs to values it would be necessary to perform one pass through the network for each action in each time step Because this would be terribly inefficient particularly in the case of Hex which has up to 169 possible actions and also because action values for a given state are highly correlated we instead follow 9 and use a network that outputs values for all actions in one pass Note that since we take the maximum over the actions in each state it is not necessary to actually follow the optimal policy to learn the optimal action values though we do need to have some probability to take each action in the optimal policy If the overlap with the policy followed and the optimal policy is greater we will generally learn faster Usually the policy used is called epsilon greedy which takes the action with the highest current Q s a estimate most t t of the time but chooses an action at random some fraction of the time This method of exploration is far from ideal and improving on it is an interesting area of research in modern RL Having learned an approximation of the optimal action values attest time we can simply pick the highest estimated action value in each state and hopefully in doing so follow a policy that is in some sense close to optimal,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Machine learning applications are limited by computational power. In this
paper, we gain novel insights into the application of quantum annealing (QA) to
machine learning (ML) through experiments in natural language processing (NLP),
seizure prediction, and linear separability testing. These experiments are
performed on QA simulators and early-stage commercial QA hardware and compared
to an unprecedented number of traditional ML techniques. We extend QBoost, an
early implementation of a binary classifier that utilizes a quantum annealer,
via resampling and ensembling of predicted probabilities to produce a more
robust class estimator. To determine the strengths and weaknesses of this
approach, resampled QBoost (RQBoost) is tested across several datasets and
compared to QBoost and traditional ML. We show and explain how QBoost in
combination with a commercial QA device are unable to perfectly separate binary
class data which is linearly separable via logistic regression with shrinkage.
We further explore the performance of RQBoost in the space of NLP and seizure
prediction and find QA-enabled ML using QBoost and RQBoost is outperformed by
traditional techniques. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion of
algorithmic constraints and trade-offs imposed by the use of this QA hardware.
Through these experiments, we provide unique insights into the state of quantum

"Domain adaptation deals with adapting behaviour of machine learning based
systems trained using samples in source domain to their deployment in target

of directly training or adapting a learner in the target domain is challenged

performance in the problem of retinal vessel segmentation where the SAE-DNN is
trained using large number of labeled samples in the source domain (DRIVE

"Image-generating machine learning models are typically trained with loss
functions based on distance in the image space. This often leads to
over-smoothed results. We propose a class of loss functions, which we call deep

computing distances in the image space, we compute distances between image
features extracted by deep neural networks. This metric better reflects
perceptually similarity of images and thus leads to better results. We show

"Disentangled distributed representations of data are desirable for machine
learning, since they are more expressive and can generalize from fewer
examples. However, for complex data, the distributed representations of
multiple objects present in the same input can interfere and lead to
ambiguities, which is commonly referred to as the binding problem. We argue for
the importance of the binding problem to the field of representation learning,
and develop a probabilistic framework that explicitly models inputs as a
composition of multiple objects. We propose an unsupervised algorithm that uses
denoising autoencoders to dynamically bind features together in multi-object
inputs through an Expectation-Maximization-like clustering process. The
effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on artificially generated datasets
of binary images, showing that it can even generalize to bind together new

"With data sizes constantly expanding, and with classical machine learning
algorithms that analyze such data requiring larger and larger amounts of
computation time and storage space, the need to distribute computation and

and multi-class SVM algorithms individually, the field of multi-class
distributed SVMs remains largely unexplored. This research proposes a novel
algorithm that implements the Support Vector Machine over a multi-class dataset

divide the dataset into half recursively and thus compute the optimal Support
Vector Machine for this half during the training phase, much like a divide and
conquer approach. While testing, this structure has been effectively exploited
to significantly reduce the prediction time. Our algorithm has shown better
computation time during the prediction phase than the traditional sequential
SVM methods (One vs. One, One vs. Rest) and out-performs them as the size of
the dataset grows. This approach also classifies the data with higher accuracy

local GPs performed more reliably with fixed spatial boundaries in spite of the discontinuities so we used this approach for all experiments For comparison we also evaluate the Sparse GP LV M implemented in GP y 23 which uses the FIT C approximation to the marginal likelihood 7 We also considered the Bayesian GP LV M 4 but found it to be more resource intensive with no meaningful

corresponding to a 3 x 3 grid nearly matches the solution quality of the full GP while requiring less time while the local methods are quite fast to converge but become stuck at inferior optima The FIT C optimization exhibits an interesting pathology it initially moves towards a good solution but then diverges towards what turns out to correspond to a contraction of the space Figure 2 d we conjecture this is because there are not enough inducing points to faithfully represent the full GP 2 The GP RF is still trans duct ive in the sense that adding a test block f will change the marginal

application to seismic event location which formed the motivation for this work Seismic waves can be viewed as high dimensional vectors generated from an underlying three dimension manifold namely the Earth s crust Nearby events tend to generate similar waveforms we can model this spatial correlation as a Gaussian Process Prior information regarding the event locations is available from traditional travel time based location systems 26 which produce an independent Gaussian uncertainty ellipse for each event A full probability model of seismic waveforms accounting for background noise and performing joint alignment of arrival times is beyond the scope of this paper To focus specifically on the ability to approximate GP LV M inference we used real event locations but generated synthetic waveforms by sampling from a 50 output GP using a Mate rn kernel 3 with 3 2 and a length scale of 40 km We also generated observed location estimates Xo bs by corrupting the true locations with 3 The astute reader will wonder how we generated synthetic data on problems that are clearly too large for an exact GP For these synthetic problems as well as the seismic example below the co variance matrix is relatively sparse with only 2 of entries corresponding to points within six kernel length scales of each other By considering only these entries we were able to draw samples using as parseC

"This paper describes how to convert a machine learning problem into a series
of map-reduce tasks. We study logistic regression algorithm. In logistic
regression algorithm, it is assumed that samples are independent and each
sample is assigned a probability. Parameters are obtained by maxmizing the

challenges to machine learning method. Training samples are so many that they
can be only stored in distributed file system and driven by map-reduce style

map-reduce spirit, each sample makes inference through a separate map
procedure. But the premise of inference is that the map procedure holds

Distributed Parameter Map-Reduce, in which not only samples, but also

of map-reduce tasks, we assign each sample parameters for its features, make
inference for the sample and update paramters of the model. The above processes

their reaction on genetic mutation. Arabidopsis Thaliana is a plant that is so
interesting, because its genetic structure has some similarities with that of

"We introduce Bayesian optimization, a technique developed for optimizing

parameterized by a low-dimensional vector. Bayesian optimization is built on a
statistical technique called Gaussian process regression, which allows
predicting the performance of a new design based on previously tested designs.
After providing a detailed introduction to Gaussian process regression, we
introduce two Bayesian optimization methods: expected improvement, for design
problems with noise-free evaluations; and the knowledge-gradient method, which
generalizes expected improvement and may be used in design problems with noisy
evaluations. Both methods are derived using a value-of-information analysis,

"In this article, we propose a new Support Vector Machine (SVM) training
algorithm based on distributed MapReduce technique. In literature, there are a
lots of research that shows us SVM has highest generalization property among
classification algorithms used in machine learning area. Also, SVM classifier
model is not affected by correlations of the features. But SVM uses quadratic
optimization techniques in its training phase. The SVM algorithm is formulated
as quadratic optimization problem. Quadratic optimization problem has $O(m^3)$
time and $O(m^2)$ space complexity, where m is the training set size. The
computation time of SVM training is quadratic in the number of training
instances. In this reason, SVM is not a suitable classification algorithm for
large scale dataset classification. To solve this training problem we developed
a new distributed MapReduce method developed. Accordingly, (i) SVM algorithm is
trained in distributed dataset individually; (ii) then merge all support
vectors of classifier model in every trained node; and (iii) iterate these two
steps until the classifier model converges to the optimal classifier function.

"Multivariate categorical data occur in many applications of machine learning.

sparsity. The number of possible observations grows exponentially with vector
length, but dataset diversity might be poor in comparison. Recent models have
gained significant improvement in supervised tasks with this data. These models
embed observations in a continuous space to capture similarities between them.

of distribution estimation of multivariate categorical data. We model vectors
of categorical variables as generated from a non-linear transformation of a
continuous latent space. Non-linearity captures multi-modality in the
distribution. The continuous representation addresses sparsity. Our model ties
together many existing models, linking the linear categorical latent Gaussian

"Majorization-minimization algorithms consist of successively minimizing a
sequence of upper bounds of the objective function. These upper bounds are
tight at the current estimate, and each iteration monotonically drives the
objective function downhill. Such a simple principle is widely applicable and
has been very popular in various scientific fields, especially in signal
processing and statistics. In this paper, we propose an incremental
majorization-minimization scheme for minimizing a large sum of continuous
functions, a problem of utmost importance in machine learning. We present
convergence guarantees for non-convex and convex optimization when the upper
bounds approximate the objective up to a smooth error; we call such upper
bounds ""first-order surrogate functions"". More precisely, we study asymptotic
stationary point guarantees for non-convex problems, and for convex ones, we
provide convergence rates for the expected objective function value. We apply
our scheme to composite optimization and obtain a new incremental proximal
gradient algorithm with linear convergence rate for strongly convex functions.
In our experiments, we show that our method is competitive with the state of

"Clustering is an essential problem in machine learning and data mining. One
vital factor that impacts clustering performance is how to learn or design the
data representation (or features). Fortunately, recent advances in deep
learning can learn unsupervised features effectively, and have yielded state of
the art performance in many classification problems, such as character
recognition, object recognition and document categorization. However, little
attention has been paid to the potential of deep learning for unsupervised
clustering problems. In this paper, we propose a deep belief network with
nonparametric clustering. As an unsupervised method, our model first leverages
the advantages of deep learning for feature representation and dimension
reduction. Then, it performs nonparametric clustering under a maximum margin
framework -- a discriminative clustering model and can be trained online
efficiently in the code space. Lastly model parameters are refined in the deep
belief network. Thus, this model can learn features for clustering and infer
model complexity in an unified framework. The experimental results show the
advantage of our approach over competitive baselines.",including pre training and fine tuning we set the learning rate as 0 1 the maximum epoch to be 100 and used CD 1 to learn the weights and biases in the Deep Belief Network We used the adjusted Rand Index 11 20 to evaluate all the clustering results Clustering on M NIST data set The M NIST data set 1 consists of 28 28 size images of hand writing digits from 0 through 9 with a training set of 60 000 examples and a test set of 10 000 examples and has been widely used to test character recognition methods In the experiment we randomly sample 5000 images from the training sets for parameter learning and 1000 examples from the testing sets to test our model After learning the features with DBN in the pre training stage we used NM MC for clustering with setting 4 15 and C 0 001 In the experiment 1 http yann lec un com exd b m nist 7 a b Figure 2 The visualization of learned weights in the pre training and fine tuning stages respectively with 1 layer DBN for n 100 on the M NIST data set 0 8 0 7 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 0 1,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"With advances in data collection technologies, tensor data is assuming
increasing prominence in many applications and the problem of supervised tensor
learning has emerged as a topic of critical significance in the data mining and
machine learning community. Conventional methods for supervised tensor learning
mainly focus on learning kernels by flattening the tensor into vectors or
matrices, however structural information within the tensors will be lost. In
this paper, we introduce a new scheme to design structure-preserving kernels
for supervised tensor learning. Specifically, we demonstrate how to leverage
the naturally available structure within the tensorial representation to encode
prior knowledge in the kernel. We proposed a tensor kernel that can preserve
tensor structures based upon dual-tensorial mapping. The dual-tensorial mapping
function can map each tensor instance in the input space to another tensor in
the feature space while preserving the tensorial structure. Theoretically, our
approach is an extension of the conventional kernels in the vector space to
tensor space. We applied our novel kernel in conjunction with SVM to real-world
tensor classification problems including brain fMRI classification for three
different diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, ADHD and brain damage by HIV).
Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed approach can
effectively boost tensor classification performances, particularly with small

"Designing effective and efficient classifier for pattern analysis is a key
problem in machine learning and computer vision. Many the solutions to the
problem require to perform logic operations such as `and', `or', and `not'.
Classification and regression tree (CART) include these operations explicitly.
Other methods such as neural networks, SVM, and boosting learn/compute a
weighted sum on features (weak classifiers), which weakly perform the 'and' and
'or' operations. However, it is hard for these classifiers to deal with the
'xor' pattern directly. In this paper, we propose layered logic classifiers for
patterns of complicated distributions by combining the `and', `or', and `not'
operations. The proposed algorithm is very general and easy to implement. We
test the classifiers on several typical datasets from the Irvine repository and
two challenging vision applications, object segmentation and pedestrian
detection. We observe significant improvements on all the datasets over the

"Kernel methods have revolutionized the fields of pattern recognition and
machine learning. Their success, however, critically depends on the choice of
kernel parameters. Using Gaussian process (GP) classification as a working
example, this paper focuses on Bayesian inference of covariance (kernel)

that, compared to standard optimization of kernel parameters, they have been
systematically demonstrated to be superior in quantifying uncertainty in
predictions. Recently, the Pseudo-Marginal MCMC approach has been proposed as a
practical inference tool for GP models. In particular, it amounts in replacing
the analytically intractable marginal likelihood by an unbiased estimate
obtainable by approximate methods and importance sampling. After discussing the
potential drawbacks in employing importance sampling, this paper proposes the
application of annealed importance sampling. The results empirically
demonstrate that compared to importance sampling, annealed importance sampling
can reduce the variance of the estimate of the marginal likelihood

"Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging
problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies
between temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the
ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the
short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections.
However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when the
long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful
modification to the standard RNN architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in
which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing
inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its
prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex,
CW-RNN reduces the number of RNN parameters, improves the performance
significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The

for variants of a sparse greedy approximation procedure for concave

allowed to obtain efficient algorithms but also important theoretical results,

convergence of the basic FW procedure. Our formulation and analysis is focused
on a general concave maximization problem on the simplex. However, the
specialization of our algorithm to quadratic forms is strongly related to some
classic methods in computational geometry, namely the Gilbert and MDM

  On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches the
guarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations obtained by
using classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a linear rate of

  On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classification

that our method is faster than the FW method with classic away steps, and works

"Submodular functions can be exactly minimized in polynomial time, and the
special case that graph cuts solve with max flow \cite{KZ:PAMI04} has had
significant impact in computer vision

the important class of sum-of-submodular (SoS) functions
\cite{Arora:ECCV12,Kolmogorov:DAM12}, which can be efficiently minimized via a
variant of max flow called submodular flow \cite{Edmonds:ADM77}. SoS functions
can naturally express higher order priors involving, e.g., local image patches;
however, it is difficult to fully exploit their expressive power because they
have so many parameters. Rather than trying to formulate existing higher order
priors as an SoS function, we take a discriminative learning approach,
effectively searching the space of SoS functions for a higher order prior that
performs well on our training set. We adopt a structural SVM approach
\cite{Joachims/etal/09a,Tsochantaridis/etal/04} and formulate the training

accordingly apply machine learning techniques. In this paper, we also address
this challenging problem and propose to use multiple kernel learning (MKL) to
combine information coming from different feature dimensions and to perform
integration at an intermediate level. Besides, we suggest to use responses of a

"Advanced combustion technologies such as homogeneous charge compression
ignition (HCCI) engines have a narrow stable operating region defined by
complex control strategies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and variable
valve timing among others. For such systems, it is important to identify the
operating envelope or the boundary of stable operation for diagnostics and
control purposes. Obtaining a good model of the operating envelope using
physics becomes intractable owing to engine transient effects. In this paper, a
machine learning based approach is employed to identify the stable operating
boundary of HCCI combustion directly from experimental data. Owing to imbalance
in class proportions in the data, two approaches are considered. A re-sampling
(under-sampling, over-sampling) based approach is used to develop models using
existing algorithms while a cost-sensitive approach is used to modify the
learning algorithm without modifying the data set. Support vector machines and
recently developed extreme learning machines are used for model development and
results compared against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive
versions of ELM and SVM algorithms are well suited to model the HCCI operating

"Latent Gaussian models (LGMs) are widely used in statistics and machine
learning. Bayesian inference in non-conjugate LGMs is difficult due to
intractable integrals involving the Gaussian prior and non-conjugate

widely employed since they strike a favorable balance between accuracy,
generality, speed, and ease of use. However, the structure of the optimization
problems associated with these approximations remains poorly understood, and
standard solvers take too long to converge. We derive a novel dual variational
inference approach that exploits the convexity property of the VG
approximations. We obtain an algorithm that solves a convex optimization
problem, reduces the number of variational parameters, and converges much
faster than previous methods. Using real-world data, we demonstrate these

"Machine learning classifiers using surface electromyography are important for
human-machine interfacing and device control. Conventional classifiers such as
support vector machines (SVMs) use manually extracted features based on e.g.
wavelets. These features tend to be fixed and non-person specific, which is a
key limitation due to high person-to-person variability of myography signals.
Deep neural networks, by contrast, can automatically extract person specific
features - an important advantage. However, deep neural networks typically have
the drawback of large numbers of parameters, requiring large training data sets
and powerful hardware not suited to embedded systems. This paper solves these
problems by introducing a compact deep neural network architecture that is much
smaller than existing counterparts. The performance of the compact deep net is
benchmarked against an SVM and compared to other contemporary architectures
across 10 human subjects, comparing Myo and Delsys Trigno electrode sets. The
accuracy of the compact deep net was found to be 84.2 +/- 6% versus 70.5 +/- 7%

Recent results connected deep feedforward neural networks with Gaussian processes, allowing training without backpropagation. This connection enables us to leverage a quantum algorithm designed for Gaussian processes and develop a new algorithm for Bayesian deep learning on quantum computers. The properties of the kernel matrix in the Gaussian process ensure the efficient execution of the core component of the protocol, quantum matrix inversion, providing an at least polynomial speedup over classical algorithms.

"The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving

In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process (GP) regression,

desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented.
But they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed in order to be

this end, this paper is devoted to the review on state-of-the-art scalable GPs

entire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace
learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse
approximations comprising prior approximations which modify the prior but
perform exact inference, posterior approximations which retain exact prior but
perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations which
exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we
highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from
multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review,
recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable GPs
are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues regarding the

"Owing to their connection with generative adversarial networks (GANs),
saddle-point problems have recently attracted considerable interest in machine
learning and beyond. By necessity, most theoretical guarantees revolve around
convex-concave (or even linear) problems; however, making theoretical inroads
towards efficient GAN training depends crucially on moving beyond this classic
framework. To make piecemeal progress along these lines, we analyze the
behavior of mirror descent (MD) in a class of non-monotone problems whose
solutions coincide with those of a naturally associated variational inequality
- a property which we call coherence. We first show that ordinary, ""vanilla"" MD
converges under a strict version of this condition, but not otherwise; in
particular, it may fail to converge even in bilinear models with a unique
solution. We then show that this deficiency is mitigated by optimism: by taking
an ""extra-gradient"" step, optimistic mirror descent (OMD) converges in all
coherent problems. Our analysis generalizes and extends the results of
Daskalakis et al. (2018) for optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in bilinear
problems, and makes concrete headway for establishing convergence beyond
convex-concave games. We also provide stochastic analogues of these results,

"Gaussian process regression is a machine learning approach which has been
shown its power for estimation of unknown functions. However, Gaussian
processes suffer from high computational complexity, as in a basic form they
scale cubically with the number of observations. Several approaches based on
inducing points were proposed to handle this problem in a static context. These
methods though face challenges with real-time tasks and when the data is
received sequentially over time. In this paper, a novel online algorithm for
training sparse Gaussian process models is presented. It treats the mean and
hyperparameters of the Gaussian process as the state and parameters of the
ensemble Kalman filter, respectively. The online evaluation of the parameters
and the state is performed on new upcoming samples of data. This procedure
iteratively improves the accuracy of parameter estimates. The ensemble Kalman
filter reduces the computational complexity required to obtain predictions with
Gaussian processes preserving the accuracy level of these predictions. The
performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the synthetic dataset and

"This paper proposes an approach to detect emotion from human speech employing
majority voting technique over several machine learning techniques. The
contribution of this work is in two folds: firstly it selects those features of
speech which is most promising for classification and secondly it uses the
majority voting technique that selects the exact class of emotion. Here,
majority voting technique has been applied over Neural Network (NN), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Input
vector of NN, DT, SVM and KNN consists of various acoustic and prosodic
features like Pitch, Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients etc. From speech
signal many feature have been extracted and only promising features have been
selected. To consider a feature as promising, Fast Correlation based feature
selection (FCBF) and Fisher score algorithms have been used and only those
features are selected which are highly ranked by both of them. The proposed
approach has been tested on Berlin dataset of emotional speech [3] and
Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) dataset [4]. The experimental result shows
that majority voting technique attains better accuracy over individual machine
learning techniques. The employment of the proposed approach can effectively

"Compared to humans, machine learning models generally require significantly
more training examples and fail to extrapolate from experience to solve
previously unseen challenges. To help close this performance gap, we augment
single-task neural networks with a meta-recognition model which learns a
succinct model code via its autoencoder structure, using just a few informative
examples. The model code is then employed by a meta-generative model to
construct parameters for the task-specific model. We demonstrate that for
previously unseen tasks, without additional training, this Meta-Learning
Autoencoder (MeLA) framework can build models that closely match the true
underlying models, with loss significantly lower than given by fine-tuned
baseline networks, and performance that compares favorably with
state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms. MeLA also adds the ability to
identify influential training examples and predict which additional data will
be most valuable to acquire to improve model prediction.",Let us now test the core desiderata of MeL A can it transform a model that is originally intended for single task learning into one that can quickly adapt to new tasks with few examples without training and continue to improve with a few gradient steps The baseline we compare with is a single network pre trained to fit to all tasks which during testing is fine tuned to each individual task through further training MeL A has the same main network architecture f as this baseline network supplemented by the meta recognition and meta generative models trained via Algorithm 1 We also compare with the state of the art meta learning algorithm MAM L 7 with the same network architecture f In addition we explore the two other MeL A capabilities influence identification and interactive learning For all experiments the true model hand its parameters are hidden from all algorithms except for an oracle model which cheats by getting access to the true model parameters for each example thus providing an upper bound on performance The performance of each algorithm is then evaluated on previously unseen test datasets For all experiments the Adam optimizer 11 with default parameters is used for training and fine tuning during evaluation 1 Simple regression problem We first demonstrate the 3 capabilities of MeL A via the same simple regression problem previously studied with MAM L 7 where the hidden function class ish x c s in x c and the parameters c U 0 1 5 0 c U 0 are randomly generated for each,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Background: Choosing the most performing method in terms of outcome
prediction or variables selection is a recurring problem in prognosis studies,
leading to many publications on methods comparison. But some aspects have
received little attention. First, most comparison studies treat prediction
performance and variable selection aspects separately. Second, methods are
either compared within a binary outcome setting (based on an arbitrarily chosen
delay) or within a survival setting, but not both. In this paper, we propose a
comparison methodology to weight up those different settings both in terms of
prediction and variables selection, while incorporating advanced machine
learning strategies. Methods: Using a high-dimensional case study on a
sickle-cell disease (SCD) cohort, we compare 8 statistical methods. In the
binary outcome setting, we consider logistic regression (LR), support vector
machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB) and neural network
(NN); while on the survival analysis setting, we consider the Cox Proportional
Hazards (PH), the CURE and the C-mix models. We then compare performances of
all methods both in terms of risk prediction and variable selection, with a
focus on the use of Elastic-Net regularization technique. Results: Among all
assessed statistical methods assessed, the C-mix model yields the better
performances in both the two considered settings, as well as interesting
interpretation aspects. There is some consistency in selected covariates across
methods within a setting, but not much across the two settings. Conclusions: It
appears that learning withing the survival setting first, and then going back
to a binary prediction using the survival estimates significantly enhance
binary predictions.",Among all assessed statistical methods assessed the C mix model yields the better performances in both the two considered settings as well as interesting interpretation aspects There is some consistency in selected co variate s across methods within a setting but not much across the two settings Conclusions It appears that learning within g the survival setting first and then going back to a binary prediction using the survival estimates significantly enhance binary predictions Keywords Hospital read mission risk High dimensional prediction Survival analysis Machine learning methods Sickle cell disease Background using Logistic Regression LR model 2 33 with Recently many statistical developments have been out reporting on the method s prediction performance performed to tackle prognostic studies analysis Be goodness of fit and over fitting aspects are neglected yon d accurate risk estimation interpretation of there namely disregarding the question is the model pre sul ts in terms of co variate s importance is required to diction still accurate on new data unseen during the assess risk factors with the ultimate aim of developing training phase While on the other hand most studies better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies 37 In most studies co variate selection ability and model focusing on a method s predictive performance do not prediction performance are regarded separately On mention its variable selection ability 21 thus mak the one hand a considerable amount of studies report ing it not well suited for the high dimensional setting on co variate s relevancy in multivariate models mostly Such settings are becoming increasingly common in a in the form of a just ed odds ratio 31 for instance context where the number of available co variate s to Correspondence simon bus sy gmail com consider as potential risk factors is tremendous esp e 1 Labor a to i rede Pro babil it es Statist i que et Mod elisa tion LPS M U MR ci ally with the development of electronic health record 8001 Sorbonne University 4 Place Jussieu 75005 Paris France Full list of author information is available at the end of the article E HR,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Professional sports are developing towards increasingly scientific training
methods with increasing amounts of data being collected from laboratory tests,
training sessions and competitions. In cycling, it is standard to equip
bicycles with small computers recording data from sensors such as power-meters,
in addition to heart-rate, speed, altitude etc. Recently, machine learning
techniques have provided huge success in a wide variety of areas where large
amounts of data (big data) is available. In this paper, we perform a pilot
experiment on machine learning to model physical response in elite cyclists. As
a first experiment, we show that it is possible to train a LSTM machine
learning algorithm to predict the heart-rate response of a cyclist during a
training session. This work is a promising first step towards developing more
elaborate models based on big data and machine learning to capture performance
aspects of athletes.",The LSTM network was trained for approximately 1 week on a Titan X Pascal GPU and obtained a final min mean and max Root Mean Squared Error RMS E of 2 51 5 62 and 25 67 on the validation set Figure 2 and Figure 3 show our trained models predictions on two samples from the validation set where the RMS E was less than 4 The model s predictions are very close to the actual heart rate measured both for an interval training session where the heart rate varies quite drastically and on a session ridden at high but rather constant velocity and power This indicates that the LSTM network has indeed managed to learn a representation for the cyclists physical response In Figure 4 we show a session where the model s prediction has a larger RMS E Towards the end of the session there are a few short steep spikes followed by a drop which our model does not capture well possibly due to the fact that it has not learnt to react to very short sprints or similar It is also likely that the heart rate monitor has recorded some spurious values lost contact towards the end when it drops to near zero Figure 2 Prediction of heart rate on an interval training session Figure 3 Prediction of heart rate on a session at relatively even pace Figure 4 A session where our model's RMS E 4 and the predicted values differ Recall that the trained LSTM model also can be used to extract compact encodings of its inputs as numeric vectors which in turn can be used to visualise the data The idea is that input data given to the model with similar features gets encoded to numeric vectors which are closer together in a multi dimensional space forming clusters as is shown in Figure 5 We speculate that the embedding s possibly could be used to cluster and classify similar training sessions interval session of varying intensity races time trials distance rides etc As the figure shows there are indeed clusters being formed but a detailed analysis of the sessions in the respective clusters is further work Discussion We note that the time series representing training sessions are very long several hours compared to for instance the time series used when training machine learning models to recognise objects in short video clips seconds Even after down sampling our data each time series is still very long This meant that training our model was somewhat time consuming preventing us to explore all modifications to the learning parameters we would have liked within the project s time frame For instance experiments with systematically excluding different input parameters and observing the re trained model s performance on the evaluation set would give us an indication of which of the inputs are most relevant for prediction We would also like to swap input output parameters and explore how this affects the model e g predicating power given heart rate instead This is further work Figure 5 Feature embedding s extracted from our LSTM model Each plot represents a training session Finally a difference compared to conventional applications of deep learning is that while our data was long the training set was not particularly big compared to for instance image recognition systems which typically are trained on sets containing at least tens of thousands of training examples In future work we will consider techniques to compensate for the relatively few but long training samples For instance one approach might have been to split each training session into smaller chunks thus getting more but shorter data However one would then of course loose information about length of the session which indeed can be relevant for performance metrics Conclusion This paper describes a first experiment in applying advanced machine learning methods on performance data collected from professional cyclists using an LSTM model We showed that is indeed possible to train such a model to predict the heart rate of a cyclist at any given point in time Our work on machine learning and performance data is still at an early stage While the heart rate prediction model we use as a first case study in this paper might not be of immediate use in performance analytics it still indicates that further investigation into similar models are worth pursuing As a next step we would like to train a model to recognise for instance some measure of intensity e g TS S or normal is ed power possibly also including data from rider s subjective experience as recorded in their training diaries Unlike heart rate which is mainly a local property these measures need to capture a representation of the whole training session The weights of the trained machine learning model would then be forced to learn a compact encoding of the whole time series from a session We speculate that the model then could be used to for instance automatically classify sessions and compute training intensity measures both over an individual session as well as over a longer training period We would also like to experiment with other machine learning architectures not just LS TMs There is interest in conducting similar experiments with data from other sports For instance the Chalmers University spin off company Ski sens AB http ski sens com are developing power meters for ski poles and are interested in analysing data collected from cross country skiers In summary applying machine learning to performance data is a new promising area of research which has the potential to provide coaches and athletes with novel software tools to help analyse categorise

"In supervised machine learning for author name disambiguation, negative

paper examines how the ratios of negative to positive training data can affect
the performance of machine learning algorithms to disambiguate author names in

Logistic Regression, Na\""ive Bayes, and Random Forest - are trained through
representative features such as coauthor names, and title words extracted from
the same training data but with various positive-negative training data ratios.
Results show that increasing negative training data can improve disambiguation

it. Logistic Regression and Na\""ive Bayes learn optimal disambiguation models
even with a base ratio (1:1) of positive and negative training data. Also, the
performance improvement by Random Forest tends to quickly saturate roughly
after 1:10 ~ 1:15. These findings imply that contrary to the common practice

"Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of ""unrolling"" an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this paper is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in signal processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the ""Vanilla LSTM"" network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date.

"Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging
task in machine learning for healthcare that can provide clinicians with better
tools for diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Existing DPM algorithms neglect
temporal dependencies among measurements and make parametric assumptions about
biomarker trajectories. In addition, they do not model multiple biomarkers
jointly and need to align subjects' trajectories. In this paper, recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues. However, in many
cases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data, which hinders the
application of standard RNNs and requires a pre-processing step such as
imputation of the missing values. We, therefore, propose a generalized training
rule for the most widely used RNN architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, that can handle missing values in both target and predictor
variables. This algorithm is applied for modeling the progression of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers. The
results show that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves a lower mean absolute
error for prediction of measurements across all considered MRI biomarkers
compared to using standard LSTM networks with data imputation or using a
regression-based DPM method. Moreover, applying linear discriminant analysis to
the biomarkers' values predicted by the proposed algorithm results in a larger
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for clinical
diagnosis of AD compared to the same alternatives, and the AUC is comparable to
state-of-the-art AUCs from a recent cross-sectional medical image
classification challenge. This paper shows that built-in handling of missing
values in LSTM network training paves the way for application of RNNs in

"With deep learning approaches becoming state-of-the-art in many speech (as
well as non-speech) related machine learning tasks, efforts are being taken to
delve into the neural networks which are often considered as a black box. In
this paper it is analyzed how recurrent neural network (RNNs) cope with
temporal dependencies by determining the relevant memory time span in a long
short-term memory (LSTM) cell. This is done by leaking the state variable with
a controlled lifetime and evaluating the task performance. This technique can
be used for any task to estimate the time span the LSTM exploits in that
specific scenario. The focus in this paper is on the task of separating

"In spite of remarkable progress in deep latent variable generative modeling,
training still remains a challenge due to a combination of optimization and
generalization issues. In practice, a combination of heuristic algorithms (such
as hand-crafted annealing of KL-terms) is often used in order to achieve the
desired results, but such solutions are not robust to changes in model
architecture or dataset. The best settings can often vary dramatically from one
problem to another, which requires doing expensive parameter sweeps for each
new case. Here we develop on the idea of training VAEs with additional
constraints as a way to control their behaviour. We first present a detailed
theoretical analysis of constrained VAEs, expanding our understanding of how
these models work. We then introduce and analyze a practical algorithm termed
Generalized ELBO with Constrained Optimization, GECO. The main advantage of
GECO for the machine learning practitioner is a more intuitive, yet principled,
process of tuning the loss. This involves defining of a set of constraints,
which typically have an explicit relation to the desired model performance, in
contrast to tweaking abstract hyper-parameters which implicitly affect the
model behavior. Encouraging experimental results in several standard datasets

"Anomaly detection is often considered a challenging field of machine learning
due to the difficulty of obtaining anomalous samples for training and the need
to obtain a sufficient amount of training data. In recent years, autoencoders
have been shown to be effective anomaly detectors that train only on ""normal""
data. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate
additional training samples for classifiers, thus making them more accurate and
robust. However, in anomaly detection GANs are only used to reconstruct
existing samples rather than to generate additional ones. This stems both from
the small amount and lack of diversity of anomalous data in most domains. In
this study we propose MDGAN, a novel GAN architecture for improving anomaly
detection through the generation of additional samples. Our approach uses two
discriminators: a dense network for determining whether the generated samples
are of sufficient quality (i.e., valid) and an autoencoder that serves as an
anomaly detector. MDGAN enables us to reconcile two conflicting goals: 1)
generate high-quality samples that can fool the first discriminator, and 2)
generate samples that can eventually be effectively reconstructed by the second
discriminator, thus improving its performance. Empirical evaluation on a
diverse set of datasets demonstrates the merits of our approach.",of our analysis show that MD GAN outperforms a widely used benchmark in the large majority of tested datasets The contributions of this study are twofold 1 we pro pose a novel GAN architecture that enable the generation Figure 1 An example of an Autoencoder with one hidden of more finely tuned training samples for one class anomaly layer detection and 2 we present an in depth analysis of the performance of our proposed approach and its components cases of one class anomaly detection i e when only nor RELATED WORK mal samples are available Er fan i et al 2016 Wei et al Anomaly Detection 2018 The Autoencoder receives a sample which can also be made noisy using dropout or a similar technique com Anomaly detection algorithms focus on finding patterns that presses it using the encoder and then attempts to reconstruct do not conform to expected behavior Anomaly detection the original sample using the decoder The discrepancy be has been applied in various areas including the fields of tween the original and reconstructed samples is captured by fraud detection Van V lasse la er et al 2015 cyber s ecu the loss function and is used to train the neural net Once rit y Kuyper s Mail l art and Pate Cornell 2016 medicine the network is trained samples with high discrepancy i e James and Da sara thy 2014 and even real time crime de highly different than expected are flagged as anomalies tec tion Rav an bakhsh et al 2017 One of the common means of measuring the discrepancy In this study we focus on spectral anomaly detection between samples is the root mean squared error RMS E methods Egil mez and Ortega 2014 Approaches of this which is calculated as type focus on generating a lower dimensionality i e com pressed representation of the data and then using it to re cid 114 1 cid 16 cid 17 construct the original data The underlying logic is that high RMS E X X cid 48 n X X cid 48 1 reconstruction error is indicative of an anomaly since the n i 1 i i characteristics of the original data are not as expected where X and X cid 48 are the vectors of the original and recon This approach includes algorithms such as principal com struct ed samples respectively pone nt analysis PCA Sh yue tal 2003 and Autoencoders Sakura da and Yair i 2014 In this study we focus on neu ral networks algorithms for anomaly detection Kw one tal Generative Adversarial Nets 2017 and specifically on Autoencoders Generative adversarial nets GANs Goodfellow et al,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"One of the biggest issues facing the use of machine learning in medical
imaging is the lack of availability of large, labelled datasets. The annotation
of medical images is not only expensive and time consuming but also highly
dependent on the availability of expert observers. The limited amount of
training data can inhibit the performance of supervised machine learning
algorithms which often need very large quantities of data on which to train to
avoid overfitting. So far, much effort has been directed at extracting as much
information as possible from what data is available. Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) offer a novel way to unlock additional information from a
dataset by generating synthetic samples with the appearance of real images.
This paper demonstrates the feasibility of introducing GAN derived synthetic
data to the training datasets in two brain segmentation tasks, leading to
improvements in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of between 1 and 5 percentage
points under different conditions, with the strongest effects seen fewer than
ten training image stacks are available.",in medical image classification tasks 1 1 Motivation Imaging features can be divided into two categories measuring either pertinent or non pertinent variance Pertinent features are those which are important to whatever information the user wishes to extract In medical imaging these are features such as the size shape intensity and location of key components such as organs or lesions Non pertinent features are those which vary between images but are unrelated to the information the user wishes to extract Examples of these are global intensity differences position within the image field of view and appearance of unrelated anatomy Exactly which features are pertinent or non pertinent will depend on the application and may not be known a priori A lot of non pertinent variance can easily be removed from a data set Com mon methods include intensity normalisation cropping and registration to a standard space These processes substantially simplify the data distribution and importantly can be applied to test instances Keeping too much non pertinent variance cannot only occlude the diagnostic ally important information but also lead to over fitting especially in the small datasets often used in medical imaging Data augmentation is an alternative to removing non pertinent variance One of the goals of data augmentation is to populate the data with a large amount of synthetic data in the directions of these non pertinent sources of variance The aim of this is to reduce this variance to noise removing any coincidental correlation with labels and preventing its use as a disc rim i native feature As noted in 11 there is a tendency within medical imaging to remove non pertinent variance rather than use augmentation This due to both the ease with which much of the non pertinent variance can be removed and the lack of suitable augmentation procedures for many sources of non pertinent variance This is reflected in 9 where the authors choose to only employ reflection and intensity augmentation for brain lesion segmentation with even the latter omit ted when using larger datasets On the other hand in 18 the authors benefit from extensive augmentation in their application of microscopy images par ti cula rly through random elastic deformations This demonstrates how careful consideration of the application will in form which types of augmentation are appropriate While random elastic deformations may be an appropriate model for microscopy images in which the objects of interest cells are generally fluid and un constrained applying the same procedure to brain images could lead to certain anatomical constraints such as symmetry rigidity and structure being disregarded In addition some sources of non pertinent variance can be nei the r removed nor augmented by traditional means For example patient specific variation in non relevant anatomy where it may not be possible to remove this anatomy through cropping or to define an accurate enough model to augment this variance with realistic cases GANs offer a potentially valuable addition to the arsenal of augmentation techniques which are currently available One of the main potential advantages of GANs is that they take many decisions away from the user in much the same way that deep learning removes the need for hand crafted features An ideal GAN will transform the discrete distribution of training samples into a continuous distribution there by simultaneously applying augmentation to each source of variance within the data set For example given a sufficient number of training examples at different orientations a GAN will learn to produce examples at any orientation replicating the effects of applying rotation augmentation While orientation is a source of variance which can easily be augmented or removed using traditional methods consider instead a more challenging source of variance such as ventricle size in brain imaging Again given a sufficient number of training examples of patients with different discrete ventricle sizes a trained GAN will be able to produce examples along the continuum of all sizes To perform the same kind of augmentation using deformations would involve a complex model of realistic ventricle size shape and impact on the surrounding anatomy By simultaneously learning the distribution of all sources of variance the GAN infers this model directly from the available data One potential limitation of using GANs for augmentation is their ability to generate images with a high enough quality While improvements have been made GANs cannot be relied upon to produce images with perfect fidelity This is not a problem for traditional augmentation procedures which do not sign if i cant ly degrade the images However both 4 and 17 demonstrate that complete realism is not necessary to improve results with synthetic data Whether the ad vantage of additional data is outweighed by the disadvantage of lower quality images is one of the questions we address in this paper 1 2 Contribution The results reported in 5 15 suggest that GANs can have a significant benefit when used for data augmentation in some classification tasks In this paper we thoroughly investigate this use of GANs in different domains for the purpose of medical image segmentation An in depth investigation into the effects of GAN augmentation is first carried out on a complex multi class Computed Tomo gra ph y CT Cerebrospinal Fluid C SF segmentation task using two segmentation architectures By choosing not to co register the images in this data set we are able to examine how GAN augmentation compares and interacts with rotation augmentation The transfer ability of the method is then evaluated by applying it to a second data set of Fluid Attenuated In version Recovery FLAIR Mag ne tic Resonance MR images for the purpose of single class White Matter Hy per intensity W MH segmentation This is a well studied problem and poses challenges typical to medical image segmentation tasks Aside from establishing whether GAN augmentation can lead to an improve ment in network performance we answer the following five important questions Does the choice of segmentation network affect this improvement How does GAN augmentation compare to rotation augmentation Does the amount of synthetic data added affect this improvement Does the amount of available real data affect this improvement Does the approach general is e to multiple datasets We also explore the distribution of generated images to better understand what modes of augmentation are provided This allows us to confirm that the GANs are producing images which are different to those in the data set We show how images are generated with the same pathology but

"Identifying changes in model parameters is fundamental in machine learning
and statistics. However, standard changepoint models are limited in
expressiveness, often addressing unidimensional problems and assuming
instantaneous changes. We introduce change surfaces as a multidimensional and
highly expressive generalization of changepoints. We provide a model-agnostic
formalization of change surfaces, illustrating how they can provide variable,
heterogeneous, and non-monotonic rates of change across multiple dimensions.
Additionally, we show how change surfaces can be used for counterfactual
prediction. As a concrete instantiation of the change surface framework, we
develop Gaussian Process Change Surfaces (GPCS). We demonstrate counterfactual
prediction with Bayesian posterior mean and credible sets, as well as massive
scalability by introducing novel methods for additive non-separable kernels.
Using two large spatio-temporal datasets we employ GPCS to discover and
characterize complex changes that can provide scientific and policy relevant
insights. Specifically, we analyze twentieth century measles incidence across
the United States and discover previously unknown heterogeneous changes after
the introduction of the measles vaccine. Additionally, we apply the model to
requests for lead testing kits in New York City, discovering distinct spatial
and demographic patterns.",of change points beyond the scope of this paper readers may con side r the literature reviews in Aue and Horv a th 2013 Ivan off and Mer z bach 2010 and A mini khan gh ahi and Cook 2017 Yet nearly all change point methods described in the statistics and machine learning literature consider system perturbations as discrete change points This literature seeks to identify instantaneous differences in parameter distributions The advantage of such models is that they provide definitive assessments of the location of one or more change points This approach is reasonable for instance when considering catastrophic events in a mechanical system such as the effect of a car crash on various embedded sensor readings Yet the challenge with these models is that real world systems rarely exhibit a clear binary transition between regimes Indeed in many applications such as in biological science instantaneous changes may be physically impossible While a handful of approaches consider non discrete change points e g Wilson et al 2012 Wilson 2014 Lloyd et al 2014 they still require linear monotonic one dimensional and in practice relatively quick changes Existing models do not provide the expressiveness necessary to model complex changes Additionally applying change points to multiple dimensions such as s patio temporal data is theoretically and practically non trivial and has thus been seldom attempted Notable exceptions include Majumdar et al 2005 who consider discrete s patio temporal change points with three additive Gaussian processes one for t t one for t t and one,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is regarded as an effective and efficient
technology to share radio spectrum among different networks. As a secondary
user (SU), a DSA device will face two critical problems: avoiding causing
harmful interference to primary users (PUs), and conducting effective
interference coordination with other secondary users. These two problems become
even more challenging for a distributed DSA network where there is no
centralized controllers for SUs. In this paper, we investigate communication
strategies of a distributive DSA network under the presence of spectrum sensing
errors. To be specific, we apply the powerful machine learning tool, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL), for SUs to learn ""appropriate"" spectrum access
strategies in a distributed fashion assuming NO knowledge of the underlying
system statistics. Furthermore, a special type of recurrent neural network
(RNN), called the reservoir computing (RC), is utilized to realize DRL by
taking advantage of the underlying temporal correlation of the DSA network.
Using the introduced machine learning-based strategy, SUs could make spectrum
access decisions distributedly relying only on their own current and past
spectrum sensing outcomes. Through extensive experiments, our results suggest
that the RC-based spectrum access strategy can help the SU to significantly
reduce the chances of collision with PUs and other SUs. We also show that our
scheme outperforms the myopic method which assumes the knowledge of system
statistics, and converges faster than the Q-learning method when the number of
channels is large.",to measure the using RC so D Q N RC converges faster if the approximation convergence speed of our proposed learning method In the is accurate In addition the results show that D Q

SUs We set the number of channels and SUs to be 6 and 2 respectively The negative reward for colliding with PU is set to 2 as well For training D Q N we collect 2000 training sequences in each

ance because the number of channels is only 6 in this experiment Clearly D Q N RC outperforms both D Q N MLP 1 and D Q N MLP 2 This is because there current structure of RC enables a more complete construction of a high dimensional functional space to approximate the network state space than MLP even though both RC and MLP have an equal number of neurons An interesting observation is that D Q N MLP 2 performs slightly worse than D Q N MLP 1 even D Q N MLP 2 has more complicated structure This is mainly because a deeper network usually needs more training data and training time to make it

"The identification and quantification of markers in medical images is
critical for diagnosis, prognosis, and disease management. Supervised machine
learning enables the detection and exploitation of findings that are known a
priori after annotation of training examples by experts. However, supervision
does not scale well, due to the amount of necessary training examples, and the
limitation of the marker vocabulary to known entities. In this proof-of-concept
study, we propose unsupervised identification of anomalies as candidates for
markers in retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging data without a

candidates occurring frequently in the data, and demonstrate that these markers

analysis of the identified data driven markers reveals how their quantifiable
occurrence aligns with our current understanding of disease course, in early-

identifies stable categories. Using these markers to classify healthy-, early

"Nesterov SGD is widely used for training modern neural networks and other machine learning models. Yet, its advantages over SGD have not been theoretically clarified. Indeed, as we show in our paper, both theoretically and empirically, Nesterov SGD with any parameter selection does not in general provide acceleration over ordinary SGD. Furthermore, Nesterov SGD may diverge for step sizes that ensure convergence of ordinary SGD. This is in contrast to the classical results in the deterministic scenario, where the same step size ensures accelerated convergence of the Nesterov's method over optimal gradient descent. To address the non-acceleration issue, we introduce a compensation term to Nesterov SGD. The resulting algorithm, which we call MaSS, converges for same step sizes as SGD. We prove that MaSS obtains an accelerated convergence rates over SGD for any mini-batch size in the linear setting. For full batch, the convergence rate of MaSS matches the well-known accelerated rate of the Nesterov's method. We also analyze the practically important question of the dependence of the convergence rate and optimal hyper-parameters on the mini-batch size, demonstrating three distinct regimes: linear scaling, diminishing returns and saturation. Experimental evaluation of MaSS for several standard architectures of deep networks, including ResNet and convolutional networks, shows improved performance over SGD, Nesterov SGD and Adam.",In section 3 we discuss the non acceleration of SGD Nesterov In section 4 we introduce MaSS and analyze its convergence and optimal hyper parameter selection In section 5 we analyze the mini batch MaSS In Section 6 we show experimental results 1 1 Related Work Over parameterized models have drawn increasing attention in the literature as many modern ma chin e learning models especially neural networks are over parameterized 5 and show strong gen era liz ation performance 16 23 2 Over parameterized models usually result in nearly perfect fit 1 Code url https g it hub com ts 66395 MaSS 2 or interpolation of the training data 23 18 3 Exponential convergence of SGD with constant step size under interpolation and its dependence on the batch size is analyzed in 12 There area few works that show or indicate the non acceleration of existing stochastic momentum methods First of all the work 9 theoretically proves non acceleration of stochastic Heavy Ball method SGD HB over SGD on certain synthetic data Furthermore these authors provide ex peri mental evidence that SGD Nesterov also converges at the same rate as SGD on the same data The work 22 theoretically shows that for sufficiently small step sizes SGD Nesterov and SGD HB is equivalent to SGD with a larger step size However the results in 22 do not exclude the possibility that acceleration is possible when the step size is larger The work 11 concludes that momentum hurts the convergence within the neighborhood of global optima based on a theoretical analysis of SGD HB These results are consistent with our analysis of the standard SGD Nesterov However this conclusion does not apply to all momentum methods Indeed we will show that MaSS provably improves convergence over SGD There is a large body of work both practical and theoretical on SGD with momentum in clu d ing 10 8 1 Adam 10 and its variant AMS Grad 17 are among the most practically used SGD methods with momentum Unlike our method Adam adaptively adjusts the step size according to a weight decayed accumulation of gradient history In 8 the authors proposed an accelerated SGD algorithm which can be written in the form shown on the right hand side in Eq 8 but with different hyper parameter selection Their A SGD algorithm also has a tail averaging step at the final stage In the interpolated setting no additive noise their analysis yields a convergence rate of O Poly exp t compared toO exp t for our algorithm with batch size 1,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Recently, with convolutional neural networks gaining significant achievements

"The expected low market penetration of connected vehicles (CVs) in the near future could be a constraint in estimating traffic flow parameters, such as average travel speed of a roadway segment and average space headway between vehicles from the CV broadcasted data. This estimated traffic flow parameters from low penetration of connected vehicles become noisy compared to 100 percent penetration of CVs, and such noise reduces the real time prediction accuracy of a machine learning model, such as the accuracy of long short term memory (LSTM) model in terms of predicting traffic flow parameters. The accurate prediction of the parameters is important for future traffic condition assessment. To improve the prediction accuracy using noisy traffic flow parameters, which is constrained by limited CV market penetration and limited CV data, we developed a real time traffic data prediction model that combines LSTM with Kalman filter based Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) noise reduction model. We conducted a case study using the Enhanced Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which contains vehicle trajectory data for every one tenth of a second, to evaluate the performance of this prediction model.

formulating inference methods that take into account the complementarity and

encoder is conditioned on a different information source. This allows us to
relate the sources via the shared latent variables by computing divergence
measures between individual source's posterior approximations. We explore a
variety of options to learn these encoders and to integrate the beliefs they
compute into a consistent posterior approximation. We visualise learned beliefs
on a toy dataset and evaluate our methods for learning shared representations

"One of the challenges of using machine learning techniques with medical data is the frequent dearth of source image data on which to train. A representative example is automated lung cancer diagnosis, where nodule images need to be classified as suspicious or benign. In this work we propose an automatic synthetic lung nodule image generator. Our 3D shape generator is designed to augment the variety of 3D images. Our proposed system takes root in autoencoder techniques, and we provide extensive experimental characterization that demonstrates its ability to produce quality synthetic images.",in an input to the

add a re connection algorithm to our output nodules to minimize illegal outputs This algorithm insures that for any input to the generative network a fully connected nodule is generated When the generator network creates animage a single fully connected component is usually generated and the recon nec tion algorithm does not need to be invoked In the case where multiple components are

"Distributed machine learning (ML) systems today use an unsophisticated threat
model: data sources must trust a central ML process. We propose a brokered
learning abstraction that allows data sources to contribute towards a
globally-shared model with provable privacy guarantees in an untrusted setting.
We realize this abstraction by building on federated learning, the state of the
art in multi-party ML, to construct TorMentor: an anonymous hidden service that
supports private multi-party ML.
  We define a new threat model by characterizing, developing and evaluating new
attacks in the brokered learning setting, along with new defenses for these
attacks. We show that TorMentor effectively protects data providers against
known ML attacks while providing them with a tunable trade-off between model
accuracy and privacy. We evaluate TorMentor with local and geo-distributed
deployments on Azure/Tor. In an experiment with 200 clients and 14 MB of data

"Many modern machine learning approaches require vast amounts of training data
to learn new concepts; conversely, human learning often requires few
examples--sometimes only one--from which the learner can abstract structural
concepts. We present a novel approach to introducing new spatial structures to
an AI agent, combining deep learning over qualitative spatial relations with
various heuristic search algorithms. The agent extracts spatial relations from
a sparse set of noisy examples of block-based structures, and trains
convolutional and sequential models of those relation sets. To create novel
examples of similar structures, the agent begins placing blocks on a virtual
table, uses a CNN to predict the most similar complete example structure after
each placement, an LSTM to predict the most likely set of remaining moves
needed to complete it, and recommends one using heuristic search. We verify
that the agent learned the concept by observing its virtual block-building
activities, wherein it ranks each potential subsequent action toward building
its learned concept. We empirically assess this approach with human
participants' ratings of the block structures. Initial results and qualitative
evaluations of structures generated by the trained agent show where it has
generalized concepts from the training data, which heuristics perform best
within the search space, and how we might improve learning and execution.",intended label but also leaves some questions unanswered from the neural nets rather than just top ranked results Can this method generalize to other shapes e g a pyr a In addition some of the constraints we impose on the mid or more complex configurations given the proper rel a system are counterproductive in the long term but do not t ional primitives In the sample data all the user generated allow for correction For instance once a block has been examples consisted of staircases oriented along the left right placed there is a hard coded constraint prohibiting it from X axis even though the the concept of a staircase could being moved meaning that any subsequent move must in also be aligned along the back to front Z axis How would vol ve placing a new block instead of moving a previously the addition of in front and behind to the vocabulary placed one to a better position even when that would more expand the search space and what other methods would be optimal ly complete the desired structure Allowing for back needed to ensure quality tracking andre planning would lessen these problems Can we use this to generalize further over an introduced concept particularly in situations where the domain space Future Work provides room for the search space to expand beyond that The trained model can be stored in a database for subsequent given in the examples Leak e and Sc hack 2015 Since even retrieval under a label of choice When the agent is again in many examples given low scores by the eva lua tors e g asked to build a staircase it can retrieve the model from Fig 4 3 rd row left the system appeared to generate some sort of stepped structure perhaps this concept can success language and vision In The AAA I 2017 Spring Symposium fully be generalized and so if ten blocks were on the table on Interactive Multi sensory Object Perception for Embodied and the system told to proceed until all blocks were placed Agents Technical ReportS S 17 05 444 448 AAA I Press would it be able to create a 4 step staircase out often blocks Alo marie tal 2017 b Al omari M Duckworth P Hog g D C and Cohn A G 2017 b Natural language ac quis i Conclusion tion and grounding for embodied robotic systems In AAA I This paper discusses a procedure for observing sparse and 4349 4356 noisy examples of a structure previously unknown to an A I Asada Uchi be and Ho soda 1999 Asada M Uchi be E agent and using them to generate new examples of st ruc and Ho soda K 1999 Cooperative behavior acquisition ture s that share the same qualities We leverage the strengths for mobile robots in dynamically changing real worlds via of deep learning to select examples out of noisy data and use vision based reinforcement learning and development Art i heuristic functions to prune the resulting search space Fu s fic i al Intelligence 110 2 275 292 ing qualitative representations with deep learning requires Barb ue tal 2012 Barb u A Mi chaux A significantly less overhead in terms of data and training time Narayana swamy S and S is kind J M 2012 Sim ul than many traditional machine learning approaches ta neo us object detection tracking and event recognition Deep learning of course is just one method of learning ar Xiv pre print ar Xiv 1204 2741 constraints and there are others such as inductive logic pro Bin ong and H az arika 2018 Bin ong J and H az arika S M g ramming which could be equally effective at managing,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Medical imaging is a domain which suffers from a paucity of manually
annotated data for the training of learning algorithms. Manually delineating
pathological regions at a pixel level is a time consuming process, especially
in 3D images, and often requires the time of a trained expert. As a result,
supervised machine learning solutions must make do with small amounts of
labelled data, despite there often being additional unlabelled data available.
Whilst of less value than labelled images, these unlabelled images can contain
potentially useful information. In this paper we propose combining both
labelled and unlabelled data within a GAN framework, before using the resulting
network to produce images for use when training a segmentation network. We
explore the task of deep grey matter multi-class segmentation in an AD dataset
and show that the proposed method leads to a significant improvement in
segmentation results, particularly in cases where the amount of labelled data
is restricted. We show that this improvement is largely driven by a greater
ability to segment the structures known to be the most affected by AD, thereby
demonstrating the benefits of exposing the system to more examples of
pathological anatomical variation. We also show how a shift in domain of the
training data from young and healthy towards older and more pathological
examples leads to better segmentations of the latter cases, and that this leads
to a significant improvement in the ability for the computed segmentations to
stratify cases of AD.",particularly in cases where the amount of labelled data is restricted We show that this improvement is largely driven by neural networks which aim to learn to produce images with the a greater ability to segment the structures known to be the most characteristics of those contained in a given training dist rib u affected by AD there by demonstrating the benefits of exposing tion A GAN consists of two components The generator maps the system to more examples of pathological anatomical variation a random vector to an image while the disc rim in at or takes an We also show how a shift in domain of the training data from image and outputs a belief as to whether it s real or synthetic young and healthy towards older and more pathological examples leads to better segmentation s of the latter cases and that this During training the disc rim in at or is provided a batch of real leads to a significant improvement in the ability for the computed and synthetic images to learn from with the loss function segmentation s to stratify cases of AD being the cross entropy loss The generator then produces a Index Terms Generative adversarial networks data aug men new batch of synthetic images and is updated according to the t ation transfer learning disc rim in at or s loss on this batch This process is repeated until convergence Many developments to this standard framework have since been proposed as well as offshoots including,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"We present a simple supervised text classification system that combines sparse and dense vector representations of words, and generalized representations of words via clusters. The sparse vectors are generated from word n-gram sequences (1-3). The dense vector representations of words (embeddings) are learned by training a neural network to predict neighboring words in a large unlabeled dataset. To classify a text segment, the different representations of it are concatenated, and the classification is performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our system is particularly intended for use by non-experts of natural language processing and machine learning, and, therefore, the system does not require any manual tuning of parameters or weights. Given a training set, the system automatically generates the training vectors, optimizes the relevant hyper-parameters for the SVM classifier, and trains the classification model. We evaluated this system on the SemEval-2017 English sentiment analysis task. In terms of average F1-score, our system obtained 8th position out of 39 submissions (F1-score: 0.632, average recall: 0.637, accuracy: 0.646).",for the cross validation We obtained dense vector representations of each task A larger search space is likely to result in a tweet simply by adding dense representations of better class i fier but also requires longer time for individual terms To obtain dense vector re pre searching sent at ions of the terms we used publicly avail As described in the previous subsections dur able pre trained vectors 6 God in et al 2015 The ing feature generation a single vector dense or vectors were learned from 400 million tweets and sparse is generated for each feature set for each each word is represented using a dense vector of instance All the three feature vectors for an in size 400 stance are simply concatenated to form a single vector prior to training For the system used for 2 2 Optimization and classification this task each combined vector consisted of a to A good value for the cost parameter of the SVM tal of 6400 features class i fier was determined via grid search The grid search included all powers of 2 between 1 and 5 Ideally identifying the optimal value re 3 Results Comments and Conclusion quires a more thorough search with an extended search space We used this small search space Despite the simplicity of our approach and limited to speed up the searching process To determine tuning it obtained 8 th position in terms of average the appropriate weight for each class first each F 1 Score out of 39 systems In addition the s ys of the three classes were assigned a weight which tem obtained average recall of 0 637 11 th and is equal to the total number of instances in the accuracy of 0 646 8 th Due to time constraints training set divided by the number of instances associated with the submission deadline for the for that class in the training set Thus for ex shared task we only performed 5 fold cross val ample the initial weight assigned to the neutral id ation and estimated optimal class weights and class was 49484 2 23 Iterating through p ossi values for the cost parameter from a small set,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

Currently, the economic domain is lacking resources and methods for data-driven supervised event detection. The detection task is conceived as a sentence-level classification task for 10 different economic event types.

"In a regression task, a predictor is given a set of instances, along with a real value for each point. Subsequently, she has to identify the value of a new instance as accurately as possible. In this work, we initiate the study of strategic predictions in machine learning.  We consider a regression task tackled by two players, where the payoff of each player is the proportion of the points she predicts more accurately than the other player. We first revise the probably approximately correct learning framework to deal with the case of a duel between two predictors.  We then devise an algorithm which finds a linear regression predictor that is a best response to any (not necessarily linear) regression algorithm. We show that it has linearithmic sample complexity, and polynomial time complexity when the dimension of the instances domain is fixed. We also test our approach in a high-dimensional setting, and show it significantly defeats classical regression algorithms in the prediction duel. Together, our work introduces a novel machine learning task that lends itself well to current competitive online settings, provides its theoretical foundations, and illustrates its applicability.",This work introduces a game theoretic view of a machine learning task After finding sufficient conditions for learning to occur we analyzed the induced learning problem when the agent is restricted to a linear response We showed that a best response with respect to a sequence of examples can be computed in polynomial time in the number of examples as long as the instance domain has a constant dimension Further we showed an algorithm that for any cid 15 computes an cid 15 best response with a probability of at least 1 when it is given a sequence of poly cid 0 1 cid 0 n log n log 1 cid 1 cid 1 cid 15 2 examples drawn i i d As the reader may notice our analysis holds as long as the hypothesis is linear in its parameters and therefore is much more general than Linear Regression Interestingly this is a novel type of optimization problem and so rich hypothesis which are somewhat unnatural in the traditional task of regression might be successfully employed in the proposed setting From an empirical standpoint the gap between the empirical payoff and the true payoff calls for applying regular iz ation methods for the best response problem and encourages further algorithmic research Exploring whether or not a response in the form of hyper planes can be effective against a more complex strategy employed by the opponent will be intriguing For instance showing that a deep learner is beat able in this setting will be remarkable The main direction to follow is the analysis of the competitive environment introduced in the beginning of Section 2 as a simultaneous game is there an equilibrium strategy Namely is there a linear predictor which when used by both the agent and the opponent is a best response to one another Acknowledgments We thank Gili Baumer andAr gyr is De lig k as for helpful discussions and anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions This project has received funding from the European Research Council ER C under the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme grant agreement n 740435,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Over the past decades, Linear Programming (LP) has been widely used in different areas and considered as one of the mature technologies in numerical optimization. However, the complexity offered by state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e. interior-point method and primal, dual simplex methods) is still unsatisfactory for problems in machine learning with huge number of variables and constraints. In this paper, we investigate a general LP algorithm based on the combination of Augmented Lagrangian and Coordinate Descent (AL-CD), giving an iteration complexity of $O((\log(1/\epsilon))^2)$ with $O(nnz(A))$ cost per iteration, where $nnz(A)$ is the number of non-zeros in the $m\times n$ constraint matrix $A$, and in practice, one can further reduce cost per iteration to the order of non-zeros in columns (rows) corresponding to the active primal (dual) variables through an active-set strategy. The algorithm thus yields a tractable alternative to standard LP methods for large-scale problems of sparse solutions and $nnz(A)\ll mn$. We conduct experiments on large-scale LP instances from $\ell_1$-regularized multi-class SVM, Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation, and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, where the proposed approach finds solutions of $10^{-3}$ precision orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art implementations of interior-point and simplex methods.",in d independent problems for each column of the estimated matrix we report result on only one of them The data source and statistics are included in the appendix Among all experiments we observe that the proposed primal dual AL CD methods become part ic ul a rly advantageous when the matrix A is sparse For example for textdata set rc v 1 real sim and news in Table 1 the matrix A is particularly sparse and AL CD can be orders of magnitude faster than other approaches by avoiding solving n n linear system exactly In addition the dual A LCD also dual simplex is more efficient in L 1 SVM problem due to the problem s strong dual sparsity while the primal A LCD is more efficient on the primal sparse Inverse Co variance estimation pro b lem For the Non negative Matrix Factorization problem both the dual and primal LP solutions are not particularly sparse due to the choice of matrix approximation tolerance 1 of samples but the AL CD approach is still comparably more efficient Acknowledgement We acknowledge the support of ARO via W 911 NF 12 1 0390 and the support of NSF via grants CCF 1320746 CCF 1117055 I IS 1149803 I IS 1320894 I IS 1447574 DMS 1264033 and NIH via R 01 GM 117594 01 as part of the Joint DMS NIG MS Initiative to Support Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Sciences,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied for many recognition problems in machine learning and computer vision. Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function very well when large number of training data is provided, the lack of probabilistic inference of the current supervised deep learning methods makes it difficult to model a complex structured output representations. In this work, we develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows a fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. In addition, we provide novel strategies to build a robust structured prediction algorithms, such as recurrent prediction network architecture, input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction training methods.

"Many applications in machine learning require optimizing unknown functions defined over a high-dimensional space from noisy samples that are expensive to obtain. We address this notoriously hard challenge, under the assumptions that the function varies only along some low-dimensional subspace and is smooth (i.e., it has a low norm in a Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space). In particular, we present the SI-BO algorithm, which leverages recent low-rank matrix recovery techniques to learn the underlying subspace of the unknown function and applies Gaussian Process Upper Confidence sampling for optimization of the function. We carefully calibrate the exploration–exploitation tradeoff by allocating sampling budget to subspace estimation and function optimization, and obtain the first subexponential cumulative regret bounds and convergence rates for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensions under noisy observations.

"Latent variable models are a powerful tool for addressing several tasks in machine learning. However, the algorithms for learning the parameters of latent variable models are prone to getting stuck in a bad local optimum. To alleviate this problem, we build on the intuition that, rather than considering all samples simultaneously, the algorithm should be presented with the training data in a meaningful order that facilitates learning. The order of the samples is determined by how easy they are. The main challenge is that often we are not provided with a readily computable measure of the easiness of samples. We address this issue by  proposing a novel, iterative self-paced learning algorithm where each iteration simultaneously selects easy samples and learns a new parameter vector. The number of samples selected is governed by a weight that is annealed until the entire training data has been considered. We empirically demonstrate that the self-paced learning algorithm outperforms the state of the art method for learning a latent structural SVM on four applications: object localization, noun phrase coreference, motif finding and handwritten digit recognition.",We tested CCC P and our self paced learning method on different values of C the average training times over all 40 experiments 20 different values of C and two different loss functions for the two methods were 1183 and 1080 seconds respectively Fig 1 compares the two methods in terms of the value of the objective function which is the main focus of this work the loss over the training data and the loss over the test data Note that self paced learning significantly improves the objective function value in 11 of the 40 experiments compared to only once when CCC P outperforms self paced learning see Fig 1 a It also provides a better training and testing loss for both MITRE and pairwise scores when using the optimal value of C see Fig 1 b c 5 2 Motif Finding Problem Formulation We consider the problem of binary classification of DNA sequences which was cast as a latent SSV M in 23 Specifically the input vector x consists of a DNA sequence of length l where each element of the sequence is a nucleotide of type A G Tor C and the output spaceY 1 1 In our experiments the classes correspond to two different types of genes,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, resulting in 17 million deaths each year. Despite the availability of various treatment options, existing techniques based upon conventional medical knowledge often fail to identify patients who might have benefited from more aggressive therapy. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a novel unsupervised machine learning approach for cardiac risk stratification. The key idea of our approach is to avoid specialized medical knowledge, and assess patient risk using symbolic mismatch, a new metric to assess similarity in long-term time-series activity. We hypothesize that high risk patients can be identified using symbolic mismatch, as individuals in a population with unusual long-term physiological activity. We describe related approaches that build on these ideas to provide improved medical decision making for patients who have recently suffered coronary attacks. We first describe how to compute the symbolic mismatch between pairs of long term electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. This algorithm maps the original signals into a symbolic domain, and provides a quantitative assessment of the difference between these symbolic representations of the original signals. We then show how this measure can be used with each of a one-class SVM, a nearest neighbor classifier, and hierarchical clustering to improve risk stratification. We evaluated our methods on a population of 686 cardiac patients with available long-term electrocardiographic data. In a univariate analysis, all of the methods provided a statistically significant association with the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days. In a multivariate analysis that incorporated the most widely used clinical risk variables, the nearest neighbor and hierarchical clustering approaches were able to statistically significantly distinguish patients with a roughly two-fold risk of suffering a major adverse cardiac event in the next 90 days.",5 1 Uni variate Results Results of uni variate analysis for all three unsupervised symbolic mismatch based approaches are presented in Table 1 The predictions from all methods showed a statistically significant i e p 0 05 association with major adverse cardiac events following ACS The results in Table 1 can be interpreted as roughly a doubled rate of adverse outcomes per unit time inpatients identified as being at high risk by the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches For the classification approach patients identified as being at high risk had a nearly 40 increased risk For comparison we also include the uni variate association of the other clinical and ECG risk var i able s in our study Table 2 Both the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches had a higher hazard ratio in this patient population than any of the other variables studied Of the clinical risk variables only age was found to be significantly associated on uni variate analysis with major cardiac events after ACS Diabetes p 0 072 was marginally outside the 5 level of significance Of the ECG risk variables both HRT and DC showed a uni variate association with major adverse cardiac events in this population These results are consistent with the clinical literature on these risk metrics 5 2 Multivariate Results We measured the correlation between the predictions of the unsupervised symbolic mismatch based approaches and both the clinical and ECG risk variables All of the unsupervised approaches had low correlation with both sets of variables R 0 2 This suggests that the results of these novel approaches can be usefully combined with results of existing approaches On multivariate analysis both the nearest neighbor approach and the clustering approach were in de pendent predictors of adverse outcomes Table 3 In our study the nearest neighbor approach for k 3 had the highest hazard ratio on both uni variate and multivariate analysis Both the nearest neighbor and clustering approaches predicted patients with an approximately two fold increased risk of adverse outcomes This increased risk did not change much even after adjusting for other clinical and ECG risk variables,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

    Modeling temporal sequences plays a fundamental role in various modern applications and has drawn more and more attentions in the machine learning community. Among those efforts on improving the capability to represent temporal data, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has achieved great success in many areas. Although the LSTM can capture long-range dependency in the time domain, it does not explicitly model the pattern occurrences in the frequency domain that plays an important role in tracking and predicting data points over various time cycles. We propose the State-Frequency Memory (SFM), a novel recurrent architecture that allows to separate dynamic patterns across different frequency components and their impacts on modeling the temporal contexts of input sequences. By jointly decomposing memorized dynamics into state-frequency components, the SFM is able to offer a fine-grained analysis of temporal sequences by capturing the dependency of uncovered patterns in both time and frequency domains. Evaluations on several temporal modeling tasks demonstrate the SFM can yield competitive performances, in particular as compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM models.

    Bayesian optimization is an efficient way to optimize expensive black-box functions such as designing a new product with highest quality or hyperparameter tuning of a machine learning algorithm. However, it has a serious limitation when the parameter space is high-dimensional as Bayesian optimization crucially depends on solving a global optimization of a surrogate utility function in the same sized dimensions. The surrogate utility function, known commonly as acquisition function is a continuous function but can be extremely sharp at high dimension - having only a few peaks marooned in a large terrain of almost flat surface. Global optimization algorithms such as DIRECT are infeasible at higher dimensions and gradient-dependent methods cannot move if initialized in the flat terrain. We propose an algorithm that enables local gradient-dependent algorithms to move through the flat terrain by using a sequence of gross-to-finer Gaussian process priors on the objective function as we leverage two underlying facts - a) there exists a large enough length-scales for which the acquisition function can be made to have a significant gradient at any location in the parameter space, and b) the extrema of the consecutive acquisition functions are close although they are different only due to a small difference in the length-scales. Theoretical guarantees are provided and experiments clearly demonstrate the utility of the proposed method at high dimension using both benchmark test functions and real-world case studies.

    We tackle the problem of optimizing a black-box objective function defined over a highly-structured input space. This problem is ubiquitous in science and engineering. In machine learning, inferring the structure of a neural network or the Automatic Statistician (AS), where the optimal kernel combination for a Gaussian process is selected, are two important examples. We use the \as as a case study to describe our approach, that can be easily generalized to other domains. We propose an Structure Generating Variational Auto-encoder (SG-VAE) to embed the original space of kernel combinations into some low-dimensional continuous manifold where Bayesian optimization (BO) ideas are used. This is possible when structural knowledge of the problem is available, which can be given via a simulator or any other form of generating potentially good solutions. The right exploration-exploitation balance is imposed by propagating into the search the uncertainty of the latent space of the SG-VAE, that is computed using variational inference. The key aspect of our approach is that the SG-VAE can be used to bias the search towards relevant regions, making it suitable for transfer learning tasks. Several experiments in various application domains are used to illustrate the utility and generality of the approach described in this work.

    Clinical prognostic models derived from largescale healthcare data can inform critical diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. To enable off-theshelf usage of machine learning (ML) in prognostic research, we developed AUTOPROGNOSIS: a system for automating the design of predictive modeling pipelines tailored for clinical prognosis. AUTOPROGNOSIS optimizes ensembles of pipeline configurations efficiently using a novel batched Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm that learns a low-dimensional decomposition of the pipelines’ high-dimensional hyperparameter space in concurrence with the BO procedure. This is achieved by modeling the pipelines’ performances as a black-box function with a Gaussian process prior, and modeling the “similarities” between the pipelines’ baseline algorithms via a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet prior. Meta-learning is used to warmstart BO with external data from “similar” patient cohorts by calibrating the priors using an algorithm that mimics the empirical Bayes method.

    We study the problem of minimizing the sum of three convex functions: a differentiable, twice-differentiable and a non-smooth term in a high dimensional setting. To this effect we propose and analyze a randomized block cubic Newton (RBCN) method, which in each iteration builds a model of the objective function formed as the sum of the natural models of its three components: a linear model with a quadratic regularizer for the differentiable term, a quadratic model with a cubic regularizer for the twice differentiable term, and perfect (proximal) model for the nonsmooth term. Our method in each iteration minimizes the model over a random subset of blocks of the search variable. RBCN is the first algorithm with these properties, generalizing several existing methods, matching the best known bounds in all special cases. We establish ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon)$, ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ and ${\cal O}(\log (1/\epsilon))$ rates under different assumptions on the component functions. Lastly, we show numerically that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on a variety of machine learning problems, including cubically regularized least-squares, logistic regression with constraints, and Poisson regression.

"Deep artificial neural networks with spatially repeated processing (a.k.a., deep convolutional ANNs) have been established as the best class of candidate models of visual processing in the primate ventral visual processing stream. Over the past five years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple feedforward eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching NASNet architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance. Here we ask, as ANNs have continued to evolve in performance, are they also strong candidate models for the brain? To answer this question, we developed Brain-Score, a composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks for determining how brain-like a model is, together with an online platform where models can receive a Brain-Score and compare against other models. 
Despite high scores, typical deep models from the machine learning community are often hard to map onto the brain's anatomy due to their vast number of layers and missing biologically-important connections, such as recurrence. To further map onto anatomy and validate our approach, we built CORnet-S: an ANN guided by Brain-Score with the anatomical constraints of compactness and recurrence. Although a shallow model with four anatomically mapped areas and recurrent connectivity, CORnet-S is a top model on Brain-Score and outperforms similarly compact models on ImageNet. Analyzing CORnet-S circuitry variants revealed recurrence as the main predictive factor of both Brain-Score and ImageNet top-1 performance.

"There is a stark disparity between the learning rate schedules used in the practice of large scale machine learning and what are considered admissible learning rate schedules prescribed in the theory of stochastic approximation. Recent results, such as in the 'super-convergence' methods which use oscillating learning rates, serve to emphasize this point even more.
One plausible explanation is that non-convex neural network training procedures are better suited to the use of fundamentally different learning rate  schedules, such as the ``cut the learning rate every constant number of epochs'' method (which more closely resembles an exponentially decaying learning rate schedule); note that this widely used schedule is in stark contrast to the polynomial decay schemes prescribed in the stochastic approximation literature, which are indeed shown to be (worst case) optimal for classes of convex optimization problems.

The main contribution of this work shows that the picture is far more nuanced, where we do not even need to move to non-convex optimization to show other learning rate schemes can be far more effective. In fact, even for the simple case of stochastic linear regression with a fixed time horizon, the rate achieved by any polynomial decay scheme is sub-optimal compared to the statistical minimax rate (by a factor of condition number); in contrast the ```''cut the learning rate every constant number of epochs'' provides an exponential improvement (depending only logarithmically on the condition number) compared to any polynomial decay scheme.  Finally, it is important to ask if our theoretical insights are somehow fundamentally tied to quadratic loss minimization (where we have circumvented minimax lower bounds for more general convex optimization problems)? Here, we conjecture that recent results which make the gradient norm small at a near optimal rate, for both convex and non-convex optimization, may also provide more insights into learning rate schedules used in practice.
",comparable to the constant and cut schemes 4 One potential explanation for this could be that in the context of neural network training local minima found by constant and cut schemes are of much better quality than those found by polynomial decay schemes while for convex problems polynomial decay schemes are indeed optimal The primary contribution of this work is to show that this is simply not the case We concretely show how mini max optimal theoretical learning rates i e polynomial decay schemes for wide classes of convex optimization problems maybe misleading and sub optimal for locally quadratic problems and the story in practice is more nuanced There important issues at play with regards to this sub optimal it y First even for the simple case of stochastic Linear Regression with a fixed time horizon the rate achieved by any polynomial decay scheme i e any choice of a b and is suboptimal compared to the statistical mini max rate i e information theoretically best possible rate achievable by any algorithm by a factor of condition number see Section 3 for definitions while there exist constant and cut schemes that are suboptimal only by a factor of log Second this work shows that a factor of suboptimal it y is unavoidable if we wish to bound the error of each iterate of SGD In other words we show that the convergence rate of lim sup of the error a st has to be necessarily suboptimal by a factor of compared to the statistical mini max rate for any learning rate sequence polynomial or not In fact atleast 1 fraction of the iterates have this suboptimal it y With this result things become quite clear all the works in stochastic approximation try to bound the error of each iterate of SGD asymptotically or lim sup of the error in other words Since this necessarily has to be suboptimal by a factor of compared to the statistical mini max rates the suboptimal it y of polynomial decay rates is not an issue However with a fixed time horizon there exist learning rate schemes with much better convergence rates while polynomial decay schemes fail to get better rates in this simpler setting of known time horizon Thirdly the work shows that for stochastic Linear Regression if we consider lim in f rather than lim sup of the error it is possible to design schemes that are suboptimal by only a factor of log compared to them in imax rates Variants of the constant and cut schemes achieve this guarantee In summary the contributions of this paper are showing how widely used pratica l learning rate schedules are in fact highly effective even in the convex case In particular our theory and empirical results demonstrate this showing that 1 https py torch org docs stable op tim html torch op tim lr scheduler Reduce LR On Plateau 2 http cs 231 n g it hub io 3 http cs 231 n g it hub io neural networks 3 4 In fact this work shows an instance where there is a significant provable difference between the per for man ce of these two schemes,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Different kinds of representation learning techniques on graph have shown significant effect in downstream machine learning tasks. Recently, in order to inductively learn representations for graph structures that is unobservable during training, a general framework with sampling and aggregating (GraphSAGE) was proposed by Hamilton and Ying and had been proved more efficient than transductive methods on fileds like transfer learning or evolving dataset. However, GraphSAGE is uncapable of selective neighbor sampling and lack of memory of known nodes that've been trained. To address these problems, we present an unsupervised method that samples neighborhood information attended by co-occurring structures and optimizes a trainable global bias as a representation expectation for each node in the given graph. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art inductive and unsupervised methods for representation learning on graphs.",against GraphS AGE For LSTM aggregator our model shows slightly poorer performance which is reasonable because LSTM aggregator causes more differences between multiple sampled neighborhoods not only the components but also the order making it harder for our bi attention layer to capture the pro xi mi ties between neighborhoods One can observe that BIG SAGE outperforms GraphS AGE in both mean and pool aggregator Another representative of evolving graphs we evaluate on is Pubmed one of the commonly used citation network data This data set contains 19717 nodes and 44324 edges Were move 20 perce ngt of the nodes as unseen the rest for training From the second column of Table 2 we find our model have better prediction results in all three aggregator s 4 3 GENERALIZING ACROSS GRAPHS Generalizing accross graphs requires inductive methods capable of learning a transferable encoder function rather than the present community structure The protein protein interaction PPI networks data set consists of 24 graphs corresponding to differ ent human tissues Zit nik Leskov ec 2017 We use the pre processed data provided by Hamilton et al 2017 b where 20 graphs for training 2 for validation and 2 for testing For each node there are 50 features representing their positional gene sets motif gene sets and immunological signatures and 121 labels set from gene ontology collected from the Molecular Signatures Database This data set contains 56944 nodes and 818716 edges The final coll um n of Table 1 shows us that our method outperforms GraphS AGE by 14 at most on the PPI data The results on three different aggregator s indicates that the Mean aggregator beats the other two in our method And we also quote the micro averaged F 1 score of SPINE which is based on the exact same PPI data set as ours 4 4 MODEL STUDY In this section we adjust BIG SAGE for tests on PPI to further study the seperate effect of bi attention layer and global bias BIG SAGE ba only with bi attention layer no global bias BIG SAGE sg with bi attention layer global bias only applied to embedding s of the last layer BIG SAGE cb with bi attention layer global bias applied to all layer during training but forgotten reset to zero matrix while generating embedding s,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Domain transfer is a exciting and challenging branch of machine learning because models must learn to smoothly transfer between domains, preserving local variations and capturing many aspects of variation without labels. 
However, most successful applications to date require the two domains to be closely related (ex. image-to-image, video-video), 
utilizing similar or shared networks to transform domain specific properties like texture, coloring, and line shapes. 
Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to transfer across modalities (ex. image-to-audio) by first abstracting the data with latent generative models and then learning transformations between latent spaces. 
We find that a simple variational autoencoder is able to learn a shared latent space to bridge between two generative models in an unsupervised fashion, and even between different types of models (ex. variational autoencoder and a generative adversarial network). 
We can further impose desired semantic alignment of attributes with a linear classifier in the shared latent space. 
The proposed variation autoencoder enables preserving both locality and semantic alignment through the transfer process, as shown in the qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
Finally, the hierarchical structure decouples the cost of training the base generative models and semantic alignments, enabling computationally efficient and data efficient retraining of personalized mapping functions. ",domain transfer also enables application such as image color iz ation Zhang et al 2017 Domain transfer is also proposed to be done through jointly training of generative models Lu 2018 Also the behavior of domain transfer models also attracts attention For example Chu et al 2017 suggests that image transfer does only local texture level transfer To enable transfer between possibly drastically different domains Our work proposes to use VAE in modeling the latent space of pre trained generative models in several aspects differentiating itself from related work Generally the modeling of latent space is different from modeling directly the data domains as most of latent generative models naturally do also the transfer in a more abstract semantics and between heterogeneous domains differs from most domain transfer method which focusing on locality and similar domains More specifically regarding modeling latent spaces Zhao et al 2017 suggests training a hier arch i c alVAEon a single domain should be done end to end whose extension to multiple domains seems non trivial and likely to suffer from data efficient issues Instead our proposed work though en a bling separation of pre trained model and conditional shared VAE apply to domain transfer setting while overcoming this shortcoming Moreover regarding shared latent space Liu et al 2017 pro poses to use shared latent space for two generative models on data domains It requires joint training of generative models on both domains using dense supervision which is infeasible for drastically different domains Our work that leverages pre trained generative model and model the latent space instead of data domains addresses to this limitation,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Accurate rent prediction in real estate investment can help in generating capital gains and guaranty a financial success. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive analysis and study of eleven machine learning algorithms for rent prediction, including Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, KNN, ML-KNN, Locally Weighted Learning, SMO, SVM, J48, lazy Decision Tree (i.e., lazy DT), and KStar algorithms. 
Our contribution in this paper is twofold: (1) We present a comprehensive analysis of internal and external attributes of a real-estate housing dataset and their correlation with rental prices. (2) We use rental prediction as a platform to study and compare the performance of eager vs. lazy machine learning methods using myriad of ML algorithms.  
We train our rent prediction models using a Zillow data set of 4K real estate properties in Virginia State of the US, including three house types of single-family, townhouse, and condo. Each data instance in the dataset has 21 internal attributes (e.g., area space, price, number of bed/bath, rent, school rating, so forth). In addition to Zillow data, external attributes like walk/transit score, and crime rate are collected from online data sources. A subset of the collected features - determined by the PCA technique-  are selected to tune the parameters of the prediction models. We employ a hierarchical clustering approach to cluster the data based on two factors of house type, and average rent estimate of zip codes. We evaluate and compare the efficacy of the tuned prediction models based on two metrics of R-squared and Mean Absolute Error, applied on unseen data. Based on our study, lazy models like KStar lead to higher accuracy and lower prediction error compared to eager methods like J48 and LR. However, it is not necessarily found to be an overarching conclusion drawn from the comparison between all the lazy and eager methods in this work.

"Unsupervised anomaly detection on multi- or high-dimensional data is of great importance in both fundamental machine learning research and industrial applications, for which density estimation lies at the core. Although previous approaches based on dimensionality reduction followed by density estimation have made fruitful progress, they mainly suffer from decoupled model learning with inconsistent optimization goals and incapability of preserving essential information in the low-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our model utilizes a deep autoencoder to generate a low-dimensional representation and reconstruction error for each input data point, which is further fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Instead of using decoupled two-stage training and the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, DAGMM jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion, leveraging a separate estimation network to facilitate the parameter learning of the mixture model. The joint optimization, which well balances autoencoding reconstruction, density estimation of latent representation, and regularization, helps the autoencoder escape from less attractive local optima and further reduce reconstruction errors, avoiding the need of pre-training. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets show that, DAGMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and achieves up to 14% improvement based on the standard F1 score.",In this section we use public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of DAG MM in unsupervised anomaly detection 4 1 DATA SET Dimensions Instances Anomaly ratio K DD CUP 120 494 021 0 2 Thyroid 6 3 772 0 025 Arrhythmia 274 452 0 15 K DD CUP Rev 120 121 597 0 2 Table 1 Statistics of the public benchmark datasets We employ four benchmark datasets K DD CUP Thyroid Arrhythmia and K DD CUP Rev K DD CUP The K DD CUP 9910 percent data set from the UCI repository Lich man 2013 originally contains samples of 41 dimensions where 34 of them are continuous and 7 are categorical For categorical features we further use one hot representation to encode them and eventually we obtain a data set of 120 dimensions As 20 of data samples are labeled as normal and the rest are labeled as attack normal samples are in a minority group therefore normal ones are treated as anomalies in this task Thyroid The Thyroid Lich man 2013 data set is obtained from the ODDS repository 1 There are 3 classes in the original data set In this task the hyper function class is treated as anomaly class and the other two classes are treated as normal class because hyper function is a clear minority class Arrhythmia The Arrhythmia Lich man 2013 data set is also obtained from the ODDS repository The smallest classes including 3 4 5 7 8 9 14 and 15 are combined to form the anomaly class and the rest of the classes are combined to form the normal class K DD CUP Rev This data set is derived from K DD CUP We keep all the data samples labeled as normal and randomly draw samples labeled as attack so that the ratio between normal and attack is 4 1 In this way we obtain a data set with anomaly ratio 0 2 where attack samples are in a minority group and treated as anomalies Note that attack samples are not fixed and we randomly draw attack samples in every single run Detailed information about the datasets is shown in Table 1 4 2 BASELINE METHODS We consider both traditional and state of the art deep learning methods as baselines OC SVM One class support vector machine Che net al 2001 is a popular kernel based method used in anomaly detection In the experiment we employ the widely adopted radial basis function R BF kernel in all the tasks DS EBM e Deep structured energy based model DS EBM Z haie tal 2016 is a state of the art deep learning method for unsupervised anomaly detection In DS EBM e sample energy is leveraged as the criterion to detect anomalies DS EBM r DS EBM e and DS EBM r Z haie tal 2016 share the same core technique but reconstruction error is used as the criterion in DS EBM r for anomaly detection 1 http odds cs stony brook edu,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

complex sequential tasks by learning directly from image input. A deep neural

The effectiveness of the GCN model is corroborated by the IEEE 123 bus benchmark system. Simulation results show that the GCN model significantly outperforms other widely-used machine learning schemes with very high fault location accuracy. In addition, the proposed approach is robust to measurement noise and data loss errors. Data visualization results of two competing neural networks are presented to explore the mechanism of GCN's superior performance. A data augmentation procedure is proposed to increase the robustness of the model under various levels of noise and data loss errors. Further experiments show that the model can adapt to topology changes of distribution networks and perform well with a limited number of measured buses.",of which are models shown in Fig 4 and Fig 5 In Fig 4 we illustrate the support We generate 20 data samples for each fault type at each of a filter when m ranges from 1 to 4 when m 5 the bus As a result a total of 13520 data samples are generated support of filters becomes the whole graph In Fig 4 the for both the training and test datasets We consider buses absolute values of the entries in m are visualized Although connected with normally closed switches or regulators as a the size of filters grows fast with the increase of m we can single bus Thus there are a total of 119 faulty buses to be observe in Fig 5 that relatively large absolute values in m classified i e 119 class labels for the classification task are mainly limited to entries corresponding to bus pairs that For the implementation of the GCN model 1 instead of using are close to each other Since the filters can be represented as n 12 as the size of the input of the model we expand X polynomials of we conclude that the locality of filters are o to include all 128 buses i e each input data sample has a ensured when the value of K is chosen properly Note that n size of 128 12 As a result each sample matrix has 1536 higher order terms in the polynomials facilitate the filters to entries 380 of which have measured values For the non explore more nodes in the graph measured buses we set the corresponding values to be zero Three baseline models are also implemented for comp ari The same measured quantity is run through the standardization son process i e subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard 1 SVM The dimensionality of the measurements is reduced deviation to 200 by principal component analysis PCA The radial basis function R BF kernel is used for the SVM with,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Data labeling is currently a time-consuming task that often requires expert

crucial to ensure that model predictions are accurate and useful. We propose
relatively simple machine learning-based models that achieve high performance

compare the performance of these algorithms to that of a data-driven approach

other models, in both the binary and multiclass classification tasks. We then
choose the logistic regression binary classifier to predict chest X-ray (CXR)/
non-chest X-ray (non-CXR) labels in reports from different datasets, unseen
during any training phase of any of the models. Even in unseen report
collections, the binary logistic regression classifier achieves average

also identify frequent tokens in CXR and non-CXR reports that are features with

"Recently, deep learning becomes the main focus of machine learning research and has greatly impacted many important fields. However, deep learning is criticized for lack of interpretability. As a successful unsupervised model in deep learning, the autoencoder embraces a wide spectrum of applications, yet it suffers from the model opaqueness as well. In this paper, we propose a new type of convolutional autoencoders, termed as Soft Autoencoder (Soft-AE), in which the activation functions of encoding layers are implemented with adaptable soft-thresholding units while decoding layers are realized with linear units. Consequently, Soft-AE can be naturally interpreted as a learned cascaded wavelet shrinkage system. Our denoising experiments demonstrate that Soft-AE not only is interpretable but also offers a competitive performance relative to its counterparts. Furthermore, we propose a generalized linear unit (GenLU) to make an autoencoder more adaptive in nonlinearly filtering images and data, such as denoising and deblurring.",while the hard threshold ing

"Data in real-world application often exhibit skewed class distribution which
poses an intense challenge for machine learning. Conventional classification
algorithms are not effective in the case of imbalanced data distribution, and
may fail when the data distribution is highly imbalanced. To address this
issue, we propose a general imbalanced classification model based on deep
reinforcement learning. We formulate the classification problem as a sequential
decision-making process and solve it by deep Q-learning network. The agent
performs a classification action on one sample at each time step, and the
environment evaluates the classification action and returns a reward to the
agent. The reward from minority class sample is larger so the agent is more
sensitive to the minority class. The agent finally finds an optimal
classification policy in imbalanced data under the guidance of specific reward
function and beneficial learning environment. Experiments show that our
proposed model outperforms the other imbalanced classification algorithms, and
it can identify more minority samples and has great classification performance.",The threshold adjustment III METHODOLOGY methods train the class i fier in original imbalanced data and A Imbalanced Classification Markov Decision Process change the decision threshold in test time A number of deep learning based methods have recently been proposed Reinforcement learning algorithms that incorporate deep for imbalanced data classification 22 26 Wang et al 22 learning have defeated world champions at the game of Go as proposed a new loss function in deep neural network which well as human experts playing numerous Atari video games can capture classification errors from both majority class and Now we regard classification problem as a guessing game minority class equally Huang et al 23 studied a method the agent receives a sample at each time step and guesses that learns more disc rim i native feature of imbalanced data classifies which category the sample belongs to and then by maintaining both inter cluster and inter class margins Yan the environment returns it an immediate reward and the next et al 24 used a boots trapping sampling algorithm which sample as shown in Fig 1 A positive reward is given to the ensures the training data in each mini batch for convolutional agent by the environment when the agent correctly guesses neural network is balanced A method to optimize the network the category of sample otherwise a negative reward is given parameters and the class sensitive costs jointly was presented to the agent When the agent learns an optimal behavior in 25 In 26 Dong et al mined hard samples in minority from its interaction with environment to get the maximum classes and improved the algorithm by batch wise optimization accumulative rewards it can correctly classify samples as with Class Rectification Loss function much as possible Now we formalize the Imbalanced Classification Markov B Reinforcement learning for classification problem Decision Process I CM DP framework which decomposes Deep reinforcement learning has recently achieved excellent imbalanced data classification task into a sequential decision results in classification tasks as it can assist class if i ers to learn making problem Assume that the imbalanced training data advantageous features or select high quality instances from set is D x l x l x l where x is the it h,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Matrix product states (MPS), a tensor network designed for one-dimensional

"This paper presents an approach for constrained Gaussian Process (GP) regression where we assume that a set of linear transformations of the process are bounded. It is motivated by machine learning applications for high-consequence engineering systems, where this kind of information is often made available from phenomenological knowledge. We consider a GP $f$ over functions on $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ taking values in $\mathbb{R}$, where the process $\mathcal{L}f$ is still Gaussian when $\mathcal{L}$ is a linear operator. Our goal is to model $f$ under the constraint that realizations of $\mathcal{L}f$ are confined to a convex set of functions. In particular, we require that $a \leq \mathcal{L}f \leq b$, given two functions $a$ and $b$ where $a < b$ pointwise. This formulation provides a consistent way of encoding multiple linear constraints, such as shape-constraints based on e.g. boundedness, monotonicity or convexity. We adopt the approach of using a sufficiently dense set of virtual observation locations where the constraint is required to hold, and derive the exact posterior for a conjugate likelihood.

"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become the most important imaging
modality in ophthalmology. A substantial amount of research has recently been
devoted to the development of machine learning (ML) models for the
identification and quantification of pathological features in OCT images. Among
the several sources of variability the ML models have to deal with, a major
factor is the acquisition device, which can limit the ML model's
generalizability. In this paper, we propose to reduce the image variability
across different OCT devices (Spectralis and Cirrus) by using CycleGAN, an
unsupervised unpaired image transformation algorithm. The usefulness of this
approach is evaluated in the setting of retinal fluid segmentation, namely
intraretinal cystoid fluid (IRC) and subretinal fluid (SRF). First, we train a
segmentation model on images acquired with a source OCT device. Then we
evaluate the model on (1) source, (2) target and (3) transformed versions of

"A graph is a powerful concept for representation of relations between pairs
of entities. Data with underlying graph structure can be found across many
disciplines and there is a natural desire for understanding such data better.
Deep learning (DL) has achieved significant breakthroughs in a variety of
machine learning tasks in recent years, especially where data is structured on
a grid, such as in text, speech, or image understanding. However, surprisingly
little has been done to explore the applicability of DL on arbitrary
graph-structured data directly.
  The goal of this thesis is to investigate architectures for DL on graphs and
study how to transfer, adapt or generalize concepts that work well on
sequential and image data to this domain. We concentrate on two important
primitives: embedding graphs or their nodes into a continuous vector space
representation (encoding) and, conversely, generating graphs from such vectors
back (decoding). To that end, we make the following contributions.
  First, we introduce Edge-Conditioned Convolutions (ECC), a convolution-like
operation on graphs performed in the spatial domain where filters are
dynamically generated based on edge attributes. The method is used to encode
graphs with arbitrary and varying structure.
  Second, we propose SuperPoint Graph, an intermediate point cloud
representation with rich edge attributes encoding the contextual relationship
between object parts. Based on this representation, ECC is employed to segment
large-scale point clouds without major sacrifice in fine details.
  Third, we present GraphVAE, a graph generator allowing us to decode graphs
with variable but upper-bounded number of nodes making use of approximate graph
matching for aligning the predictions of an autoencoder with its inputs. The
method is applied to the task of molecule generation.",Discrete Nature Similar to text and unlike images graphs are discrete structures Incremental construction with auto regressive methods involves discrete decisions which are not differentiable and thus problematic for gradient based optimization methods common in DL In sequence generation this is typically circumvented by a maximum likelihood objective with so called teacher forcing Williams and Zip ser 1989 which allows to decompose the generation into a sequence of conditional decisions and maximize the likelihood of each of them However the choice of such a decomposition for graphs is not clear as we argue above and teacher forcing is prone the inability to fix its mistakes resulting in possibly poor prediction performance if the conditioning context diverges from sequences seen during training Be ng io et al 2015 On the other hand generation of graphs in a probabilistic formulation can only postpone dealing with non different i abl it y issues to the final step when the disc ret i zed graph has to be output Large Graphs The level to which the locality and compositional it y principles apply to a particular graph can strongly vary due to possibly arbitrary connectivity for example a generator should be able to output both a path and a complete graph This seems problematic for scaling up to large graphs as one cannot trivially enforce some form of hierarchical decomposition or coarse to fine construction conceptually similar to using up sampling operators in images Radford et al 2015 This may bring about the necessity to use more parameters while having less regular iz ation implied by the architecture design in the case a feed forward network For auto regressive methods large graphs may make training difficult due to very long chains of construction steps especially for denser graphs 1 2 Summary of Contributions Having charted the two main directions of this thesis and their challenges we sum ma

"When fitting Bayesian machine learning models on scarce data, the main challenge is to obtain suitable prior knowledge and encode it into the model. Recent advances in meta-learning offer powerful methods for extracting such prior knowledge from data acquired in related tasks. When it comes to meta-learning in Gaussian process models, approaches in this setting have mostly focused on learning the kernel function of the prior, but not on learning its mean function. In this work, we explore meta-learning the mean function of a Gaussian process prior. We present analytical and empirical evidence that mean function learning can be useful in the meta-learning setting, discuss the risk of overfitting, and draw connections to other meta-learning approaches, such as model agnostic meta-learning and functional PCA.",while experimental details are deferred to the appendix Sec D Baselines Throughout the experiments we mainly compare four different approaches a a na ve GP prior zero mean and R BF kernel which we call vanilla GP b deep kernel learning 46 with a zero mean function c a learned deep mean function our proposed model with an R BF kernel and d a learned deep mean function with a learned deep kernel The neural networks used for the learned mean functions and the learned kernels share the exact same architecture except for the last layer which is of size 1 for the mean function and of size 2 for the kernel Note that we aim to purely compare the benefits of learning kernels and mean functions in general here and not to achieve the maximum performance on the chosen tasks We hence refrain from comparing these approaches to more sophisticated meta learning models and leave this to future work Performance measures In our experiments we assess the performance of the models on the target tasks with two different measures the test mean squared error MSE and the test data log likelihood often just denoted as likelihood Note that the likelihood depends on the whole predictive posterior while the MSE only depends on its mean Since the mean function of the GP only affects the posterior by shifting its mean it can be hypothesized that learning a good mean function for the GP will affect the MSE more strongly than the likelihood Similarly since the kernel function parameter ize s the co variance of the process it could be expected to affect the likelihood more strongly than the MSE When interpreting the results of our experiments one should therefore keep in mind that the MSE slightly favors GPs with a good mean function while the likelihood slightly favors good kernel functions However the decision which one of the two measures is more important depends on the intended use of the GP in the target task If the GP is used to predict values at test points from its predictive posterior mean the MSE is the more relevant measure If it is instead used to draw multiple samples from the whole posterior or to estimate the probability of different outcomes the likelihood is more relevant We do not make any limiting assumptions on the use cases in this work and the ultimate decision for a measure and therefore potentially a preferred model is left to the practitioner Step function regression To assess the performance of the mean function learning approach on a traditionally more challenging problem for GPs and compare it to kernel learning we chose the,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"We present Deep Neural Decision Forests - a novel approach that unifies classification trees with the representation learning functionality known from deep convolutional networks, by training them in an end-to-end manner. To combine these two worlds, we introduce a stochastic and differentiable decision tree model, which steers the representation learning usually conducted in the initial layers of a (deep) convolutional network. Our model differs from conventional deep networks because a decision forest provides the final predictions and it differs from conventional decision forests since we propose a principled, joint and global optimization of split and leaf node parameters. We show experimental results on benchmark machine learning datasets like MNIST and ImageNet and find on-par or superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep models. Most remarkably, we obtain Top5-Errors of only 7.84%/6.38% on ImageNet validation data when integrating our forests in a single-crop, single/seven model GoogLeNet architecture, respectively.

"A general machine learning architecture is introduced that uses wavelet
scattering coefficients of an inputted three dimensional signal as features.
Solid harmonic wavelet scattering transforms of three dimensional signals were
previously introduced in a machine learning framework for the regression of
properties of small organic molecules. Here this approach is extended for
general steerable wavelets which are equivariant to translations and rotations,
resulting in a sparse model of the target function. The scattering coefficients
inherit from the wavelets invariance to translations and rotations. As an
illustration of this approach a linear regression model is learned for the
formation energy of amorphous lithium-silicon material states trained over a
database generated using plane-wave Density Functional Theory methods.

approaches over similarly generated databases.",maps the scattering coefficients nicely on to the T F DW model it is only an approximation of the true ground state energy of anatomist ic state Furthermore there is information loss in the summing of the wavelet modulus coefficients These considerations provide further motivation for including higher order scattering coefficients 6 as features in our regression model 3 2 System size in variance We seek to build a machine learning model to predict the formation energy per Li Si formula unit 1 of an infinitely large periodic atomic state see section 4 below The formation energy is independent of system size number of atoms and therefore our features must recover this additional invariant Normalizing the input signals to the wavelet transform gives signals cid 107 cid 107 q and cid 126 lj cid 107 cid 126 lj cid 107 q which results in the following features that are invariant to system size cid 107 cid 126 cid 107 q cid 107 cid 126 cid 126 cid 107 q lj q 1 l 1 j 1 2 l 2 j 2 q 7 cid 107 cid 107 q cid 107 cid 126 cid 107 q q 1 l 1 j 1 q These features are normalized versions of the features 5 and 6 Infinitely large amorphous systems are inherently disordered and as such can be modeled as a 3 D com pound Poisson process in space where the location of an atom is an arrival event of the process In practice plane waveD FT simulations utilize a finite unit cell with periodic boundary that creates order within the system however this phenomena is mitigated by tak inga large enough unit cell In 34 general wavelets are used to compute scattering coefficients using a similar normalization to 7 There it is shown that normalized first and second order scattering co eff i ci ents characterize regular Poisson processes in 1 D We can thus interpret these scattering coefficients 7 as statistical moments of We train a second order model using these normalized features on a database Figure 3 Formation energies of a Li Si specified in section 4 and discuss the results of our 1 Green crystalline states are not used but numerical experiments in section 5 shown here for reference In the atomic st ruc ture sLi atoms are green and Si are yellow,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Short-term traffic flow prediction is one of the crucial issues in
intelligent transportation system, which is an important part of smart cities.
Accurate predictions can enable both the drivers and the passengers to make
better decisions about their travel route, departure time and travel origin
selection, which can be helpful in traffic management. Multiple models and
algorithms based on time series prediction and machine learning were applied to
this issue and achieved acceptable results. Recently, the availability of
sufficient data and computational power, motivates us to improve the prediction
accuracy via deep-learning approaches. Recurrent neural networks have become
one of the most popular methods for time series forecasting, however, due to
the variety of these networks, the question that which type is the most
appropriate one for this task remains unsolved. In this paper, we use three
kinds of recurrent neural networks including simple RNN units, GRU and LSTM
neural network to predict short-term traffic flow. The dataset from TAP30
Corporation is used for building the models and comparing RNNs with several
well-known models, such as DEMA, LASSO and XGBoost. The results show that all
three types of RNNs outperform the others, however, more simple RNNs such as
simple recurrent units and GRU perform work better than LSTM in terms of
accuracy and training time.",In this section we declare our RNNs specifications and introduce the metrics that evaluations are performed based on them Then we evaluate different RNN models on our data set and see how well they can predict the requests in the future In addition we compare our model with 3 other baselines and show that RNNs outperform all 4 1 Experimental Setup Our data set is obtained from TAP 30 Co ride requests in Tehran from September 1 st to December 20 th 2017 We used the first prior 80 days to train the models and last 30 days for validation All three kinds of recurrent neural networks SimpleR NN GRU LSTM were implemented in Ker as API built on top of Tensor flow Although recurrent neural networks can accept sequences with any length as input because of the nature of our problem we had to choose a constant sequence length Due to the constrained computational power we had we used every hour data as a sequence Because the time interval for each data point is 15 minutes each sequence consists of four data points Since the data contains records for 110 days the shape of data would be 110 24 4 68 Table 3 includes the list of parameters used in the experiment for all three types of RNNs 4 2 Evaluation metrics We use root mean absolute error RMS E and mean absolute percentage error MAP E to evaluate the models These metrics are defined as follows cid 118 cid 117 n cid 117 1 cid 88 RMS E cid 116 yi y i 2 10 n t 1 t 1 i 1 1 cid 88 n yi y i MAP E t 1 t 1 11 n yi i 1 t 1 Where yi andy i mean the real and prediction value for demand in region i for time interval t 1 and n denotes t 1 t 1 total number of samples 4 3 Experimental Results First were port the performance of RNNs RMS E and MAP E over the entire city all selected regions and then we report the errors on each category of regions,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"A linear multi-factor model is one of the most important tools in equity
portfolio management. The linear multi-factor models are widely used because
they can be easily interpreted. However, financial markets are not linear and
their accuracy is limited. Recently, deep learning methods were proposed to
predict stock return in terms of the multi-factor model. Although these methods
perform quite well, they have significant disadvantages such as a lack of
transparency and limitations in the interpretability of the prediction. It is
thus difficult for institutional investors to use black-box-type machine
learning techniques in actual investment practice because they should show
accountability to their customers. Consequently, the solution we propose is
based on LSTM with LRP. Specifically, we extend the linear multi-factor model
to be non-linear and time-varying with LSTM. Then, we approximate and linearize
the learned LSTM models by LRP. We call this LSTM+LRP model a deep recurrent
factor model. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of the Japanese stock

the traditional linear model and fully-connected deep learning methods.",multi factor model is calculated for the investment universe whereas the factor return linear i zed by L RP is calculated for

"Recent work has shown that decentralized algorithms can deliver superior
performance over centralized ones in the context of machine learning. The two
approaches, with the main difference residing in their distinct communication
patterns, are both susceptible to performance degradation in heterogeneous
environments. Although vigorous efforts have been devoted to supporting
centralized algorithms against heterogeneity, little has been explored in
decentralized algorithms regarding this problem.
  This paper proposes Hop, the first heterogeneity-aware decentralized training
protocol. Based on a unique characteristic of decentralized training that we
have identified, the iteration gap, we propose a queue-based synchronization
mechanism that can efficiently implement backup workers and bounded staleness
in the decentralized setting. To cope with deterministic slowdown, we propose
skipping iterations so that the effect of slower workers is further mitigated.
We build a prototype implementation of Hop on TensorFlow. The experiment
results on CNN and SVM show significant speedup over standard decentralized
training in heterogeneous settings.",self loops are omit correct queue to en queue or de queue a worker determines ted with increasing node degrees 1 Ring graph 17 20 21 the queue index by computing the modulo mod it er queues Nodes are connected in a circle via bidirectional edges 2 A where queues is the total number of queues queues is set to ring based graph 20 On top of the ring graph every node max ig 1 because a worker can receive updates of at most is also connected to the most distant node 3 Double ring max ig 1 different newer or current iterations based on graph Two ring based graphs are connected node to node Theorem 1 In standard case Section 4 1 a worker can only receive newer or current updates and it can always de queue the correct updates in the backup worker case Section 4 3 a worker can receive older updates as well but the older ones will be discarded Our solution essentially divides the original large single queue into multiple small ones and the total space consumed basically remains the same As for distinguishing the sender via the w id tag it can Figure 12 Effect of heterogeneity left CNN right SVM also be achieved by defining multiple queues But it is not necessary in our system since we only use the w id tag when 7 Experiments employing bounded staleness which only requires processing 7 1 Data set and Models one pass of all entries among the entries with the same w id tag the mostrecent one is retained and the rest are discarded We evaluate Hop on two machine learning tasks namely image classification and web spam detection For image classification 6 2 Handling Late Updates we train the VGG 11 26 network on CI FAR 10 18 for web spam detection we trainS VM over the web spam data set 11 As mentioned in Section 4 3 when using backup workers 7 2 Experiments Setup updates that are not used in the Reduce can accumulate in the We use a CPU cluster with 1000 Mbit s ethernet connection to queue In our design the effect of stale updates is mitigated run 16 workers on 4 machines each machine has 4 workers in the following two ways a Stale updates are found and We use the following hyper parameter setup as prescribed in discarded in the de queue de queue many operation in later http leon bot to u org projects sgd and AD P SGD 21 with iterations This is already incorporated in our system as de some modifications batch size 128 learning rate 0 1 for scribe d in Section 6 1 b Inquire the receiver s iteration before VGG and 10 for SVM no learning rate decay policy is used sending the update If the receiver s iteration is larger than the momentum 0 9 weight decay 10 4 for VGG and 10 7 for local worker s iteration do not send the update This method SVM We use log loss for SVM instead of hinge loss creates a small communication overhead but can save much more when the update is stale More importantly it can ef 7 3 Results and Analysis fec t iv ely reduce the number of stale updates now the only 7 3 1 Heterogeneity with Random Slowdown We simulate source of stale updates are those that are on the fly when the a heterogeneous environment by randomly slowing down ev receiver performs the de queue de queue many e ry worker by 6 times at a probability of 1 n in each iteration We have also considered a more customized structure pro where n is the number of workers We conduct experiments vi ded by TENSOR FLOW called the conditional accumulator with and without slowdown on three different communication which only accepts updates sent with a correct local step an graphs labeled as ring ring based and double ring as shown other notion for iteration If the local step is incorrect then in Figure 11 and the result is illustrated in Figure 12 None the update will be dropped It seemed to be a perfect solution of the graphs is immune to the slowdown Moreover we see to the problem but we have observed in experiments that this that sparser graphs suffer less to random slowdown property cannot be always ensured The update that is up to 7 3 2 Comparison to Parameter Servers For decentralized date when it is sent can end up stale when it is received and algorithm training is conducted on a ring based topology the conditional accumulator will incorrectly accept the update Figure 11 for PS we adopt B SP and use one additional This is exactly the same problem we have encountered with machine as the parameter server As shown in Figure 13 F IF O queues with the on the fly stale updates decentralized training in either heterogeneous or homogeneous,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"A machine learning system can score well on a given test set by relying on heuristics that are effective for frequent example types but break down in more challenging cases. We study this issue within natural language inference (NLI), the task of determining whether one sentence entails another. We hypothesize that statistical NLI models may adopt three fallible syntactic heuristics: the lexical overlap heuristic, the subsequence heuristic, and the constituent heuristic. To determine whether models have adopted these heuristics, we introduce a controlled evaluation set called HANS (Heuristic Analysis for NLI Systems), which contains many examples where the heuristics fail. We find that models trained on MNLI, including BERT, a state-of-the-art model, perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that they have indeed adopted these heuristics. We conclude that there is substantial room for improvement in NLI systems, and that the HANS dataset can motivate and measure progress in this area",P arik he tal 2016 uses a form of attention to

"Generative Adversial Networks (GANs) have made a major impact in computer
vision and machine learning as generative models. Wasserstein GANs (WGANs)
brought Optimal Transport (OT) theory into GANs, by minimizing the
$1$-Wasserstein distance between model and data distributions as their
objective function. Since then, WGANs have gained considerable interest due to
their stability and theoretical framework. We contribute to the WGAN literature
by introducing the family of $(q,p)$-Wasserstein GANs, which allow the use of
more general $p$-Wasserstein metrics for $p\geq 1$ in the GAN learning
procedure. While the method is able to incorporate any cost function as the
ground metric, we focus on studying the $l^q$ metrics for $q\geq 1$. This is a
notable generalization as in the WGAN literature the OT distances are commonly
based on the $l^2$ ground metric. We demonstrate the effect of different
$p$-Wasserstein distances in two toy examples. Furthermore, we show that the
ground metric does make a difference, by comparing different $(q,p)$ pairs on
the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that changing the
ground metric and $p$ can notably improve on the common $(q,p) = (2,1)$ case.",it is clear that the natori strained for choosing meaningful projections essen metric used for GANs should be tailored to fit the needs of ti al when working with high dimensional data The authors the application report increased stability in training and show that the train ing objective is an upper bound for the true distance between Finally the OT theory suggests that the Kantor o vich po the generator and target distribution tent i als or disc rim in at or s can also function as generators through their gradients We try this on theM NIST data set Geneva y et al 2017 on the other hand rely on the fa and conclude that the generator clearly improves the results vor able computational properties of relaxing the original OT problem with en tropic pen aliz ation Instead of rely in gon the dual Rubinstein Kantor o vich formulation they 2 Background compute the Sink horn divergence Cut uri 2013 between We briefly summarize the p requisites for this work The mini batches in the primal formulation This also allows methodology is founded on optimal transport which we omitting learning a disc rim in at or however the authors do will revise first We finish the section by reviewing the propose learning a cost function as they argue the l 2 ground mathematical details of GANs with a focus on W GANs metric is not suitable in every application The hyper pa ra meters of the Sink horn divergence allows interpolating 2 1 Optimal Transport between the 2 Wasser stein distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy MM D providing more freedom the in the The aim in Optimal Transport OT is to define a geometric metric model choice This method also allows for a general framework for the study of probability measures This is cost function to be used like our q p WG AN method carried out by defining a cost function between samples e g but the experiments are limited to the p 2 and learned the l 2 metric and then studying transport plans that relate distance function cases without comparison two compared probability measures to each other while minimizing the total cost A common example states the Wu et al 2018 introduce the Wasser stein divergence mot i problem as moving a pile of dirt into another with minimal va ted by the gradient penalty approach on the 1 Wasser stein effort by finding an optimal allocation for each grain of dirt metric The divergence builds on the dual formulation by so that the cumulative distance of dirt moved is minimized relaxing the Lipschitz constraint Additionally a gradient q p Wasser stein GANs West art with basic definitions and conclude by discussing then according to the fundamental theorem of optimal trans the Wasser stein metric The interested reader may refer to port the Kantor o vich potentials satisfy c and thus Villani 2008 for theoretical and P eyre Cut uri 2017 for 5 can be written as computational aspects of OT OT max E E c 8 c Optimal Transport Problem Let be a probability me a c ADM c sure on a metric space X denoted by M X Let reducing the optimization to be carried out over a single f X Y be a measurable map Then f A function f 1 A denotes the push forward of with respect to f Here A is any measurable set in another metric space Wasser stein Metric It turns out that the OT framework Y The push for wad can be also explained from a sampling can be used to define a distance between probability d is tri perspective assume is a random variable with distribution but ions Define the set The nf has distribution f cid 26 cid 12 cid 90 cid 27 Given two probability me a sur es M X and P d p X M X cid 12 cid 12 cid 12 dp x 0 x d x 9 M Y we define the set of ad miss able plans by for any x X Then OT defines a metric between,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hippocampus segmentation plays a key role in diagnosing various brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, depression and others. Nowadays, segmentation is still mainly performed manually by specialists. Segmentation done by experts is considered to be a gold-standard when evaluating automated methods, buts it is a time consuming and arduos task, requiring specialized personnel. In recent years, efforts have been made to achieve reliable automated segmentation. For years the best performing authomatic methods were multi atlas based with around 80-85% Dice coefficient and very time consuming, but machine learning methods are recently rising with promising time and accuracy performance. A method for volumetric hippocampus segmentation is presented, based on the consensus of tri-planar U-Net inspired fully convolutional networks (FCNNs), with some modifications, including residual connections, VGG weight transfers, batch normalization and a patch extraction technique employing data from neighbor patches. A study on the impact of our modifications to the classical U-Net architecture was performed. Our method achieves cutting edge performance in our dataset, with around 96% volumetric Dice accuracy in our test data. In a public validation dataset, HARP, we achieve 87.48% DICE. GPU execution time is in the order of seconds per volume, and source code is publicly available.

"Several recent trends in machine learning theory and practice, from the design of state-of-the-art Gaussian Process to the convergence analysis of deep neural nets (DNNs) under stochastic gradient descent (SGD), have found it fruitful to study wide random neural networks. Central to these approaches are certain scaling limits of such networks. We unify these results by introducing a notion of a straightline \emph{tensor program} that can express most neural network computations, and we characterize its scaling limit when its tensors are large and randomized. From our framework follows (1) the convergence of random neural networks to Gaussian processes for architectures such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, residual networks, attention, and any combination thereof, with or without batch normalization; (2) conditions under which the \emph{gradient independence assumption} -- that weights in backpropagation can be assumed to be independent from weights in the forward pass -- leads to correct computation of gradient dynamics, and corrections when it does not; (3) the convergence of the Neural Tangent Kernel, a recently proposed kernel used to predict training dynamics of neural networks under gradient descent, at initialization for all architectures in (1) without batch normalization. Mathematically, our framework is general enough to rederive classical random matrix results such as the semicircle and the Marchenko-Pastur laws, as well as recent results in neural network Jacobian singular values. We hope our work opens a way toward design of even stronger Gaussian Processes, initialization schemes to avoid gradient explosion/vanishing, and deeper understanding of SGD dynamics in modern architectures.",Tensor programs are meant to represent the body of a neural network where all dimensions are large compared to input and output dimensions The CDC s are used to capture the varying widths of practical neural networks for example while widths typically increase and decrease in classical networks they are held constantin blocks in residual networks see Appendix B 3 for an example For the first read through were commend the reader to assume all dimensions are the same so that there is a single CDC consisting of allG var s The sampling of A var s reflects variants of Gl or ot initialization Gl or ot Be ng io 2010 used in practice The sampling of input G var s models the distribution of the first hidden layer across multiple inputs sampling of the first layer parameters see Appendix B 1 for an example and or sampling of bias vectors Most often the vector var s should be thought of as hidden layer quantities whose dimensions goto infinity neural network inputs of fixed dimension are indirectly expressed as above and outputs of fixed dimension are obtained as some coordinates of a vector var 8 We could as well assume that there is an infinite 2 D array of independent Gaussian variables A l N 0 1 and at time t ij i j 1 set Alt ltA l cid 112 n lt In that case we do not need nc t to increase strict y with t ij ij 2,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"The deep network model, with the majority built on neural networks, has been
proved to be a powerful framework to represent complex data for high

"The objective of this work is to study the applicability of various Machine
Learning algorithms for prediction of some rock properties which geoscientists
usually define due to special lab analysis. We demonstrate that these special
properties can be predicted only basing on routine core analysis (RCA) data. To
validate the approach core samples from the reservoir with soluble rock matrix
components (salts) were tested within 100+ laboratory experiments. The
challenge of the experiments was to characterize the rate of salts in cores and
alteration of porosity and permeability after reservoir desalination due to
drilling mud or water injection. For these three measured characteristics, we
developed the relevant predictive models, which were based on the results of
RCA and data on coring depth and top and bottom depths of productive horizons.
To select the most accurate Machine Learning algorithm a comparative analysis
has been performed. It was shown that different algorithms work better in
different models. However, two hidden layers Neural network has demonstrated
the best predictive ability and generalizability for all three rock
characteristics jointly. The other algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine
and Linear Regression, also worked well on the dataset, but in particular
cases. Overall, the applied approach allows predicting the alteration of
porosity and permeability during desalination in porous rocks and also
evaluating salt concentration without direct measurements in a laboratory. This
work also shows that developed approaches could be applied for prediction of
other rock properties (residual brine and oil saturations, relative
permeability, capillary pressure, and others), which laboratory measurements
are time-consuming and expensive.",of RCA and data on coring depth and top and bottom depths of productive horizons To select the most accurate Machine Learning algorithm a comparative analysis has been performed It was shown that different algorithms work better in different models However two hidden layers Neural network has demonstrated the best predictive ability and general iz ability for all three rock characteristics jointly The other algorithms such as Support Vector Machine and Linear Regression also worked well on the data set but in particular cases Overall the applied approach allows predicting the alteration of porosity and permeability during desalination in porous rocks and also evaluating salt concentration without direct measurements in a laboratory This work also shows that developed approaches could be applied for prediction of other rock properties residual brine and oil saturation s relative permeability capillary pressure and others which laboratory measurements are time consuming and expensive Keywords machine learning routine and special core analysis reservoir properties salted formations porosity and permeability alteration,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an unsupervised machine-learning
bipartite graphical model that jointly learns a probability distribution over
data and extracts their relevant statistical features. As such, RBM were
recently proposed for characterizing the patterns of coevolution between amino
acids in protein sequences and for designing new sequences. Here, we study how
the nature of the features learned by RBM changes with its defining parameters,
such as the dimensionality of the representations (size of the hidden layer)
and the sparsity of the features. We show that for adequate values of these
parameters, RBM operate in a so-called compositional phase in which visible
configurations sampled from the RBM are obtained by recombining these features.
We then compare the performance of RBM with other standard representation
learning algorithms, including Principal or Independent Component Analysis,
autoencoders (AE), variational auto-encoders (VAE), and their sparse variants.
We show that RBM, due to the stochastic mapping between data configurations and
representations, better capture the underlying interactions in the system and
are significantly more robust with respect to sample size than deterministic
methods such as PCA or ICA. In addition, this stochastic mapping is not
prescribed a priori as in VAE, but learned from data, which allows RBM to show
good performance even with shallow architectures. All numerical results are

"Single index model is a powerful yet simple model, widely used in statistics, machine learning, and other scientific fields. It models the regression function as $g(<a,x>)$, where a is an unknown index vector and x are the features. This paper deals with a nonlinear generalization of this framework to allow for a regressor that uses multiple index vectors, adapting to local changes in the responses. To do so we exploit the conditional distribution over function-driven partitions, and use linear regression to locally estimate index vectors. We then regress by applying a kNN type estimator that uses a localized proxy of the geodesic metric. We present theoretical guarantees for estimation of local index vectors and out-of-sample prediction, and demonstrate the performance of our method with experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets, comparing it with state-of-the-art methods.",For example on the Yacht data set the generalization error improves by more than 30 percent for J 5 compared to SIM Notice though that increasing the number of localized pieces does not always improve the performance This can mostly be attributed to the fact that splitting the original data set into disjoint subgroups reduces the number of samples within each group which has a detrimental effect on the variance of the estimator In other words we face a typical bias variance trade off implying that hyper parameter J needs to be carefully selected Furthermore sometimes a SIM is indeed the best fit to the data e g Boston data set As shown in the experiments in Section 5 this will be detected by our approach when combined with cross validation to choose J Related work To the best of our knowledge relaxations of SIM have not yet been considered in this form However three research areas are highly relevant linear single and multi index models nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction and manifold regression Below we provide a short overview of the most significant and relevant achievements in each of these fields Single and multi index models have been extensively researched and we therefore restrict ourselves to conceptually related work Most studies focus only on the estimation of index vector s which started with the early work on Linear Regression based methods 4 14 31 40 1 https archive ics uci edu ml datasets html,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Differential privacy is a strong notion for privacy that can be used to prove formal guarantees, in terms of a privacy budget, $\epsilon$, about how much information is leaked by a mechanism. However, implementations of privacy-preserving machine learning often select large values of $\epsilon$ in order to get acceptable utility of the model, with little understanding of the impact of such choices on meaningful privacy. Moreover, in scenarios where iterative learning procedures are used, differential privacy variants that offer tighter analyses are used which appear to reduce the needed privacy budget but present poorly understood trade-offs between privacy and utility. In this paper, we quantify the impact of these choices on privacy in experiments with logistic regression and neural network models. Our main finding is that there is a huge gap between the upper bounds on privacy loss that can be guaranteed, even with advanced mechanisms, and the effective privacy loss that can be measured using current inference attacks. Current mechanisms for differentially private machine learning rarely offer acceptable utility-privacy trade-offs with guarantees for complex learning tasks: settings that provide limited accuracy loss provide meaningless privacy guarantees, and settings that provide strong privacy guarantees result in useless models.

"Deep neural networks have been widely deployed in various machine learning
tasks. However, recent works have demonstrated that they are vulnerable to
adversarial examples: carefully crafted small perturbations to cause
misclassification by the network. In this work, we propose a novel defense
mechanism called Boundary Conditional GAN to enhance the robustness of deep
neural networks against adversarial examples. Boundary Conditional GAN, a
modified version of Conditional GAN, can generate boundary samples with true
labels near the decision boundary of a pre-trained classifier. These boundary
samples are fed to the pre-trained classifier as data augmentation to make the
decision boundary more robust. We empirically show that the model improved by
our approach consistently defenses against various types of adversarial attacks
successfully. Further quantitative investigations about the improvement of
robustness and visualization of decision boundaries are also provided to
justify the effectiveness of our strategy. This new defense mechanism that uses
boundary samples to enhance the robustness of networks opens up a new way to

"Many wireless networks, including 5G NR (New Radio) and future beyond 5G cellular systems, are expected to operate on multiple frequency bands. This paper considers the band assignment (BA) problem in dual-band systems, where the basestation (BS) chooses one of the two available frequency bands (centimeter-wave and millimeter-wave bands) to communicate with the user equipment (UE). While the millimeter-wave band might offer higher data rate, there is a significant probability of outage during which the communication should be carried on the (more reliable) centimeter-wave band. With mobility, the BA can be perceived as a sequential problem, where the BS uses previously observed information to predict the best band for a future time step. We formulate the BA as a binary classification problem and propose supervised Machine Learning (ML) solutions. We study the problem when both the BS and the UE use (i) omnidirectional antennas and (ii) both use directional antennas. In the omnidirectional case, we derive analytical benchmark solutions based on the Gaussian Process (GP) assumption for the inter-band shadow fading. In the directional case, where the labeling is shown to be complex, we propose an efficient labeling approach based on the Viterbi Algorithm (VA). We compare the performances for two channel models: (i) a stochastic channel and (ii) a ray-tracing based channel.",two bands For joint communication in the two bands 25 are promising ML based solutions are able to provide com proposes a two queue model to assign data to each band such petit ive performance for problems where optimal solutions that delay is minimized and throughput is maximized Ref are known e g using multi layer Neural Networks NN s 27 considers the down link resource allocation in a network for decoding in AW GN channel 22 indicating that ML may with a small cell BS where the BS aims to assign the UE or also be applied to problems where traditional methods have services to the resources in the two bands failed or where the environment is too complex For instance The BA can be viewed as a handover process between Ref 23 demonstrated the efficacy of ML based detection two co located BS s with different frequencies Refs 28 30 over a molecular system where the channel characteristics are used ML approaches to address the handover and switching difficult to model between BS s that may use different frequency bands In Similarly for the simplified BA problems that can be 29 the authors use ML to improve the success rate in the handled analytically one shot BA in a Gaussian stochastic handover between two co located cells in different bands their channel ML solutions show comparative performance to the implemented ML class i fier uses the prior channel measure optimum closed form solutions 13 Motivated by this and ment s and handover decisions within a temporal window to due to the complexity of the sequential BA we propose to predict the success of the handover Ref 28 introduces an solve the BA problem using supervised ML techniques with uplink U Link down link D Link decoupling concept where various features combinations The solutions are based on the central BS gathers measurements of the Ric ian K factor feed forward NN and recurrent NN the Long Short Term and the D Link reference signal received power for both bands Memory LSTM We consider systems with omni directional and trains a non linear ML algorithm that is then applied to and directional antennas to capture different aspects of the the cm Wave band data to predict the target frequencies and BA problem We use the omni directional system to study BS that can be used for the U Link and D Link Ref 30 uses a the basic problem and derive analytical benchmarks in a gated recurrent NN to predict handover status at the next time synthesized stochastic environment In particular with the slot given the beam sequence where the BS uses the sequence common assumption that the shadow fading is normally of previously used beam forming vectors as input to the ML distributed in decibel dB scale the analytical solution scheme Different from these works we use various sets of maps the observed GP to the BA decision based on the features and several ML algorithms for omni directional and probabilities of the achieved rates The directional systems directional systems in two different environments this help can be viewed as a generalization where the system needs identifying the limitations of the solutions and the impact of to identify the best direction to use at the link ends and the features We also consider an analytical solution based on incorporate the increased overhead from band switching GP for the BA problem which allows us to benchmark the As we discuss below acquiring labeled data when using ML solution Furthermore we propose an efficient labeling directional antennas is challenging To solve this we adopt scheme i e providing a key enable r for the supervised ML basic principles of the 5 G NR beam searching architecture based BA solutions and use the VA to propose an efficient heuristic labeling Channel state prediction using GP or ML was considered algorithm that takes the accumulated rate into account In in several works such as 31 34 where Refs 31 34 use addition to the synthetic data set that we use to compare GP to predict the shadowing values in the network based on collected drive tests while Refs 31 33 use regression ML 3 Note that the same concepts have been used in different wireless ap techniques to predict the channel state Using ML to predict pli cations such as localization where the mapping between the channel information and location is used in fingerprinting approaches 16 unobserved channel features was also considered in 35 36,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Graph partitioning is the problem of dividing the nodes of a graph into
balanced partitions while minimizing the edge cut across the partitions. Due to
its combinatorial nature, many approximate solutions have been developed,
including variants of multi-level methods and spectral clustering. We propose
GAP, a Generalizable Approximate Partitioning framework that takes a deep
learning approach to graph partitioning. We define a differentiable loss
function that represents the partitioning objective and use backpropagation to
optimize the network parameters. Unlike baselines that redo the optimization
per graph, GAP is capable of generalization, allowing us to train models that
produce performant partitions at inference time, even on unseen graphs.
Furthermore, because we learn the representation of the graph while jointly
optimizing for the partitioning loss function, GAP can be easily tuned for a
variety of graph structures. We evaluate the performance of GAP on graphs of
varying sizes and structures, including graphs of widely used machine learning
models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, and Inception-V3), scale-free graphs, and random
graphs. We show that GAP achieves competitive partitions while being up to 100
times faster than the baseline and generalizes to unseen graphs.",In International conference on machine N No rou zi M Be ng io S and Dean J 2017 learning pages 478 487 Device placement optimization with reinforcement Xu and Tan 2012 Xu Y and Tan G 2012 learning In IC ML h metis based offline road network partitioning In Ng et al 2002 Ng A Y Jordan M I and Weiss Asia Sim 2012 pages 221 229 Springer Y 2002 On spectral clustering Analysis and Yang et al 2017 Yang B Fu X Sidi ro poul os an algorithm In Advances in neural information N D and Hong M 2017 Towards k means processing systems pages 849 856 friendly spaces Simultaneous deep learning and Papa dimitri ou and Steiglitz 1982 Papa dimitri ou clustering In Proceedings of the 34 th International C H and Steiglitz K 1982 Comb in a to Conference on Machine Learning Volume 70 pages rial Optimization Algorithms and Complexity 3861 3870 J ML R org Prentice Hall Inc Upper Saddle River NJ USA Zhang and Rohe 2018 Zhang Y and Rohe K Shah am et al 2018 Shah am U Stanton K Li 2018 Understanding regularized spectral clu s H N adler B Ba sri R and K luger Y 2018 te ring via graph conductance In Neu rIPS pages Spectral net Spectral clustering using deep neural 10654 10663 networks ar Xiv pre print ar Xiv 1801 01587 Zheng et al 2016 Zheng Y Tan H Tang B Shi and Malik 2000 Shi J and Malik J 2000 Zhou H et al 2016 Variation al deep embedding Normalized cuts and image segmentation IEEE A generative approach to clustering ar xiv pre print Trans Pattern Anal Mach In tell 22 8 888 905 ar Xiv pre print ar Xiv 1611 05148 Simony an and Z is ser man 2014 Simony an K and Z is ser man A 2014 Very deep convolutional networks for large scale image recognition ar Xiv pre print ar Xiv 1409 1556 Sze ged y et al 2017 Sze ged y C I of fe S Van hou cke V and Alem i A A 2017 Inception v 4 inception ResNet and the impact of residual con nec t ions on learning In AAA I volume 4 page 12 Van Den Bout and Miller 1990 Van Den Bout D E and Miller T K 1990 Graph parti tion ing using annealed neural networks IEEE Transactions on neural networks 1 2 192 203 Veli ck ovi c et al 2018 Veli ck ovi c P Cu cur ull G Casanova A Romero A Li o P and Be ng io Y 2018 Graph Attention Networks International Conference on Learning Representations 13,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Consider the lifelong machine learning paradigm whose objective is to learn a sequence of tasks depending on previous experiences, e.g., knowledge library or deep network weights. However, the knowledge libraries or deep networks for most recent lifelong learning models are with prescribed size, and can degenerate the performance for both learned tasks and coming ones when facing with a new task environment (cluster). To address this challenge, we propose a novel incremental clustered lifelong learning framework with two knowledge libraries: feature learning library and model knowledge library, called Flexible Clustered Lifelong Learning (FCL3). Specifically, the feature learning library modeled by an autoencoder architecture maintains a set of representation common across all the observed tasks, and the model knowledge library can be self-selected by identifying and adding new representative models (clusters). When a new task arrives, our proposed FCL3model firstly transfers knowledge from these libraries to encode the new task, i.e.,effectively and selectively soft-assigning this new task to multiple representative models over feature learning library. Then, 1) the new task with a higher outlier probability will be judged as a new representative, and used to redefine both feature learning library and representative models over time; or 2) the new task with lower outlier probability will only refine the feature learning library. For model optimization, we cast this lifelong learning problem as an alternating direction minimization problem as a new task comes. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework by analyzing several multi-task datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our FCL3 model can achieve better performance than most lifelong learning frameworks, even batch clustered multi-task learning models.",of our H D H D FC L 3 model compared with the state of the art lifelong T 1 T T 1 T 1 H D H D H D H D machine learning and

"In the last five years, the financial industry has been impacted by the
emergence of digitalization and machine learning. In this article, we explore
two methods that have undergone rapid development in recent years: Gaussian
processes and Bayesian optimization. Gaussian processes can be seen as a
generalization of Gaussian random vectors and are associated with the
development of kernel methods. Bayesian optimization is an approach for
performing derivative-free global optimization in a small dimension, and uses
Gaussian processes to locate the global maximum of a black-box function. The

connected. In particular, we focus on the Gaussian process regression, which is
the core of Bayesian machine learning, and the issue of hyperparameter
selection. The second part is dedicated to two financial applications. We first
consider the modeling of the term structure of interest rates. More precisely,
we test the fitting method and compare the GP prediction and the random walk
model. The second application is the construction of trend-following

"In the past decade, the usage of mobile devices has gone far beyond simple
activities like calling and texting. Today, smartphones contain multiple
embedded sensors and are able to collect useful sensing data about the user and
infer the user's context. The more frequent the sensing, the more accurate the
context. However, continuous sensing results in huge energy consumption,
decreasing the battery's lifetime. We propose a novel approach for cost-aware
sensing when performing continuous latent context detection. The suggested
method dynamically determines user's sensors sampling policy based on three
factors: (1) User's last known context; (2) Predicted information loss using
KL-Divergence; and (3) Sensors' sampling costs. The objective function aims at
minimizing both sampling cost and information loss. The method is based on
various machine learning techniques including autoencoder neural networks for
latent context detection, linear regression for information loss prediction,
and convex optimization for determining the optimal sampling policy. To
evaluate the suggested method, we performed a series of tests on real-world
data recorded at a high-frequency rate; the data was collected from six mobile
phone sensors of twenty users over the course of a week. Results show that by
applying a dynamic sampling policy, our method naturally balances information
loss and energy consumption and outperforms the static approach.% We compared
the performance of our method with another state of the art dynamic sampling
method and demonstrate its consistent superiority in various measures. %Our
methods outperformed, and were able to improve we achieved better results in
either sampling cost or information loss, and in some cases we improved both.",show that our method successfully performs an energy information loss trade off that can be controlled by setting different weights in the objective function This enables context aware applications to be accurate while consuming less energy Moreover when comparing our method to another state of the art dynamic method it outperformed in both the sampling cost and information loss measures in some cases while in other cases our method achieved better results in one of those measures Figure 4 Normalized mean information loss and mean cost In the future we plan to implement and evaluate our method as a function of information loss weight within a context aware application and compare the performances of personal vs non personal models In addition we plan to improve our method by adding features election on users sensors data This In order to compare our method toRa chur i s method we imp le is due to the assumption that some features may perform better ment edit with a few necessary adjustments First since our data is than others for different users Furthermore we wish to use hybrid not labeled we weren table to train event class if i ers Therefore in models which optimize the sampling policy based on both personal order to determine whether an interesting event has occurred we and non personal models The hybrid models solve the cold start calculated the KL Divergence between every pair of consecutive problem when there is insufficient user data or when model s error sensor records and used the 90 quan tile as a threshold Second exceeds a predetermined threshold since we use offline simulations we could only change the time Personal Dynamic Cost Aware Sensing for Latent Context Detection Conference 17 July 2017 Washington DC USA,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"This paper looks into the problem of detecting network anomalies by analyzing
NetFlow records. While many previous works have used statistical models and
machine learning techniques in a supervised way, such solutions have the
limitations that they require large amount of labeled data for training and are
unlikely to detect zero-day attacks. Existing anomaly detection solutions also
do not provide an easy way to explain or identify attacks in the anomalous
traffic. To address these limitations, we develop and present GEE, a framework
for detecting and explaining anomalies in network traffic. GEE comprises of two
components: (i) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) - an unsupervised deep-learning
technique for detecting anomalies, and (ii) a gradient-based fingerprinting
technique for explaining anomalies. Evaluation of GEE on the recent UGR dataset
demonstrates that our approach is effective in detecting different anomalies as
well as identifying fingerprints that are good representations of these various

"Eye movements during text reading can provide insights about reading
disorders. Via eye-trackers, we can measure when, where and how eyes move with

this information and provide differential analysis. This work developed
DysLexML, a screening tool for developmental dyslexia that applies various ML
algorithms to analyze fixation points recorded via eye-tracking during silent

measurements collected in a systematic field study with 69 native Greek

governmental agency for diagnosing learning and reading difficulties in Greece.
We examined a large set of features based on statistical properties of
fixations and saccadic movements and identified the ones with prominent
predictive power, performing dimensionality reduction. Specifically, DysLexML
achieves its best performance using linear SVM, with an a accuracy of 97 %,
with a small feature set, namely saccade length, number of short forward
movements, and number of multiply fixated words. Furthermore, we analyzed the
impact of noise on the fixation positions and showed that DysLexML is accurate
and robust in the presence of noise. These encouraging results set the basis
for developing screening tools in less controlled, larger-scale environments,

"Multi-fidelity methods are prominently used when cheaply-obtained, but
possibly biased and noisy, observations must be effectively combined with
limited or expensive true data in order to construct reliable models. This
arises in both fundamental machine learning procedures such as Bayesian
optimization, as well as more practical science and engineering applications.
In this paper we develop a novel multi-fidelity model which treats layers of a
deep Gaussian process as fidelity levels, and uses a variational inference
scheme to propagate uncertainty across them. This allows for capturing
nonlinear correlations between fidelities with lower risk of overfitting than
existing methods exploiting compositional structure, which are conversely
burdened by structural assumptions and constraints. We show that the proposed
approach makes substantial improvements in quantifying and propagating
uncertainty in multi-fidelity set-ups, which in turn improves their

"In this research, an emotion recognition system is developed based on valence/arousal model using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG signals are decomposed into the gamma, beta, alpha and theta frequency bands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and spectral features are extracted from each frequency band. Principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to the extracted features by preserving the same dimensionality, as a transform, to make the features mutually uncorrelated. Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used to classify emotional states. The cross-validated SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel using extracted features of 10 EEG channels, performs with 91.3% accuracy for arousal and 91.1% accuracy for valence, both in the beta frequency band.

"Electronic health records are an increasingly important resource for
understanding the interactions between patient health, environment, and
clinical decisions. In this paper we report an empirical study of predictive
modeling of several patient outcomes using three state-of-the-art machine
learning methods. Our primary goal is to validate the models by interpreting
the importance of predictors in the final models. Central to interpretation is
the use of feature importance scores, which vary depending on the underlying
methodology. In order to assess feature importance, we compared univariate
statistical tests, information-theoretic measures, permutation testing, and
normalized coefficients from multivariate logistic regression models. In
general we found poor correlation between methods in their assessment of
feature importance, even when their performance is comparable and relatively
good. However, permutation tests applied to random forest and gradient boosting
models showed the most agreement, and the importance scores matched the
clinical interpretation most frequently.",The results for each disease grouped by ML method and prediction horizon is shown in Fig 2 We find across d is eases that XG Boost X GB performs the best followed closely by RF LR under performs these tree based Ensemble methods especially for predicting Alzheimer s disease and esophageal reflux The differences in performance between the methods on all diseases at each prediction horizon are significant p 9 5 e 12 according to pairwise Wilcox on rank sum tests with Bon ferro ni correction 25 We find reasonably high AU ROC performance across diseases With a one year prediction horizon the best model XG Boost achieved median AU ROC values of 0 85 for Alzheimer s disease 0 91 for Diabetes 0 96 for Diabetes with renal manifestations 0 85 for esophageal reflux 0 91 for kidney disease 0 88 for liver disease and 0 87 for sleep apnea We find that predictive ability diminishes as the prediction horizon increases as expected The exception is the predictions for esophageal reflux that trend higher for the Ensemble methods with longer prediction horizons We find that across diseases the GIN i importance scores for XG Boost do not align very well with the expected importance scores An example of this is shown in the scatter plots in Fig 3 which shows XG Boost and RF importance measures using both GIN i importance top and permutation importance bottom for the diabetes models From left to right the prediction horizon increases We expected the presence of a hemoglobin A 1 c lab to be very predictive of outcome one visit prior to diagnosis and for other risk indicators such as high average glucose levels high BMI and high triglycerides to be more predictive at six months to one year We see this behavior with the RF importance scores to an extent but observe less intelligible GIN i importance scores from the XG Boost model The XG Boost GIN i importance scores suggest the anion gap measure a potential sign of diabetic ketoacidosis 26 and age a universal risk factor are the most important However the permutation importance measure applied to both models bottom generated good agreement with expected predictors and also shows that the two models actually agree to a large extent about which factors are important XG Boost tends to over estimate the importance of age on nearly every outcome likely due to the bias of the GIN i importance measure discussed earlier Age is a continuous variable in our analysis it is calculated using the visit date so despite being corrected for via quart ile matching among the controls there appears to be enough variability 0 10 0 08 0 06 0 04 0 02 0 00 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 RF importance ec na tro pm i BG X Diabetes,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The emergence of an ageing population is a significant public health concern.
This has led to an increase in the number of people living with progressive
neurodegenerative disorders like dementia. Consequently, the strain this is
places on health and social care services means providing 24-hour monitoring is
not sustainable. Technological intervention is being considered, however no
solution exists to non-intrusively monitor the independent living needs of
patients with dementia. As a result many patients hit crisis point before
intervention and support is provided. In parallel, patient care relies on
feedback from informal carers about significant behavioural changes. Yet, not
all people have a social support network and early intervention in dementia
care is often missed. The smart meter rollout has the potential to change this.

can be disaggregated to detect which home appliances are turned on and off.

"Chest X-rays (CXRs) are among the most commonly used medical image
modalities. They are mostly used for screening, and an indication of disease
typically results in subsequent tests. As this is mostly a screening test used
to rule out chest abnormalities, the requesting clinicians are often interested
in whether a CXR is normal or not. A machine learning algorithm that can
accurately screen out even a small proportion of the ""real normal"" exams out of
all requested CXRs would be highly beneficial in reducing the workload for
radiologists. In this work, we report a deep neural network trained for
classifying CXRs with the goal of identifying a large number of normal
(disease-free) images without risking the discharge of sick patients. We use an
ImageNet-pretrained Inception-ResNet-v2 model to provide the image features,
which are further used to train a model on CXRs labelled by expert
radiologists. The probability threshold for classification is optimized for
100% precision for the normal class, ensuring no sick patients are released. At
this threshold we report an average recall of 50%. This means that the proposed
solution has the potential to cut in half the number of disease-free CXRs
examined by radiologists, without risking the discharge of sick patients.",in subsequent tests As this is mostly a screening test used to rule out chest abnormalities the requesting clinicians are often interested in whether a CX R is normal or not A machine learning algorithm that can accurately screen out even a small proportion of the real normal exams out of all requested CX Rs would be highly beneficial in reducing the workload for radiologists In this work we report a deep neural network trained for classifying CX Rs with the goal of identifying a large number of normal disease free images without risking the discharge of sick patients We use an Image Net pre trained Inception ResNet v 2 model to provide the image features which are further used to train a model on CX Rs labelled by expert radiologists The probability threshold for classification is optimized for 100 precision for the normal class ensuring no sick patients are released At this threshold we report an average recall of 50 This means that the proposed solution has the potential to cut in half the number of disease free CX Rs examined by radiologists without risking the discharge of sick patients Keywords Chest X ray workload reduction deep learning transfer learning,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Programming languages are emerging as a challenging and interesting domain
for machine learning. A core task, which has received significant attention in
recent years, is building generative models of source code. However, to our
knowledge, previous generative models have always been framed in terms of
generating static snapshots of code. In this work, we instead treat source code
as a dynamic object and tackle the problem of modeling the edits that software
developers make to source code files. This requires extracting intent from
previous edits and leveraging it to generate subsequent edits. We develop
several neural networks and use synthetic data to test their ability to learn
challenging edit patterns that require strong generalization. We then collect
and train our models on a large-scale dataset of Google source code, consisting
of millions of fine-grained edits from thousands of Python developers. From the
modeling perspective, our main conclusion is that a new composition of
attentional and pointer network components provides the best overall
performance and scalability. From the application perspective, our results
provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility of developing tools that learn
to predict future edits.",that are within 5 of the best accuracy are bolded POMP Position Oracle Match Pattern E Explicit baseline model IR Implicit baseline model I A Improved implicit model Non Meta Meta POMP E IR I A POMP E IR I A Append 1 100 0 100 0 100 0 99 9 100 0 99 9 13 9 83 0 Context Append 11 100 0 100 0 98 6 99 9 100 0 99 5 2 5 96 3 Context Append 13 100 0 100 0 98 6 100 0 100 0 100 0 73 5 98 9 Delete 2 100 0 100 0 99 9 99 9 100 0 100 0 94 9 99 8 Flip 11 100 0 99 7 82 8 98 8 99 9 99 1 10 0 92 4 Replace 2 100 0 100 0 99 7 100 0 100 0 99 8 93 7 98 5 Surround 11 100 0 100 0 91 2 99 8 99 9 99 6 12 1 98 5 Context Append 31 99 9 99 5 76 9 98 5 95 9 95 7 18 0 94 3 Context Reverse 31 99 9 99 4 72 6 98 1 95 9 95 3 14 4 94 4 Context Append 33 99 7 99 6 76 3 98 9 95 9 99 3 73 3 97 5 Context Append 52 37 6 99 2 74 6 99 3 11 9 97 2 63 0 97 5 Context Reverse 51 37 6 99 0 59 5 95 2 11 9 94 7 22 6 92 4 Flip 33 11 8 98 7 76 8 98 3 9 2 97 5 73 9 96 3 Surround 33 11 8 99 6 79 5 99 6 9 2 99 1 74 9 99 0 Multi Task N A 50 0 43 2 53 7 6 1 EXPERIMENTS ON SYNTHETIC DATA Accuracy The first question is how well the various models perform in terms of accuracy For each of the synthetic tasks described in the Appendix we generated datasets of size 10 k 1 k 1 k instances for train dev test respectively Initial sequences are of length L 30 and the voc ab size is V 10 For all meta problems we give the model conditional steps to let it recognize the meta character for each example For evaluation we measure average accuracy for each edit conditional on given past edits where both position and content must be correct for an edit to be considered correct To better understand how strong of generalization is required we develop the Position Oracle Match Pattern POMP baseline POMP assumes an oracle identifies the position where an edit needs to be made and marks the pattern part of the current state using terminology from Section 5 Predictions for the changes needed to turn the pattern into the replacement are then done via pattern matching If a test pattern appears anywhere in the training data POMP is assumed to get all predictions correct otherwise it guesses uniformly at random Were port the expected performance of POMP In the cases where POMP achieve slow accuracy few of the patterns seen attest time appeared at training time which shows that these tasks require a strong form of generalization We can also interpret POMP as an upper bound on performance of any model based on counts of pattern replacement pairs seen in training data as would happen if we tried to adapt n gram models to this task In Table 1 were port test performance for the hyper parameter setting and step that yield best dev performance The explicit model and the improved implicit model can solve nearly all the tasks even those that involve meta characters and relatively long sequences of replacements Note that the POMP accuracy for many of these tasks is near chance level performance indicating that most test replacements were never seen at training time In the Appendix we provide more statistics about the synthetic datasets that give additional explanation for the varying performance across tasks Evaluating S cal ability Here we explore questions of s cal ability as the length of the state and the number of edits grow We use a simple data set where the pattern is a single character and the replacement comes from a randomly sampled n gram language model In all cases we use n 3 and set the number of insertions to one of 10 50 100 Note that this simultaneously increases the size of the explicit state M and the number of edits T The s cal ability metric is the average time required to run training on 128 sequences on a single P 100 GPU averaged over 1000 training steps As shown in Figure 4 the explicit model is consistently more expensive than the implicit models and the gap grows as the size of the data increases The length 100 insertion sequences are ten times 1 The semantics are chosen to align with Python s re library import re re sub B r 1 B 1 1 DBB A yields DB DDB A,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Extreme Multi-label classification (XML) is an important yet challenging
machine learning task, that assigns to each instance its most relevant
candidate labels from an extremely large label collection, where the numbers of
labels, features and instances could be thousands or millions. XML is more and
more on demand in the Internet industries, accompanied with the increasing
business scale / scope and data accumulation. The extremely large label
collections yield challenges such as computational complexity, inter-label
dependency and noisy labeling. Many methods have been proposed to tackle these
challenges, based on different mathematical formulations. In this paper, we
propose a deep learning XML method, with a word-vector-based self-attention,
followed by a ranking-based AutoEncoder architecture. The proposed method has
three major advantages: 1) the autoencoder simultaneously considers the
inter-label dependencies and the feature-label dependencies, by projecting
labels and features onto a common embedding space; 2) the ranking loss not only
improves the training efficiency and accuracy but also can be extended to
handle noisy labeled data; 3) the efficient attention mechanism improves
feature representation by highlighting feature importance. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets show the proposed method is competitive to
state-of-the-art methods.",we report the average P k and n k on at least 1 increase up to almost 20 improve testing set with k 1 3 5 respectively ment on Delicious data When compared with Hyper

"Since its introduction, television has been the main channel of investment
for advertisements in order to influence customers purchase behavior. Many have
attributed the mere exposure effect as the source of influence in purchase
intention and purchase decision; however, most of the studies of television
advertisement effects are not only outdated, but their sample size is
questionable and their environments do not reflect reality. With the advent of
the internet, social media and new information technologies, many recent
studies focus on the effects of online advertisement, meanwhile, the investment
in television advertisement still has not declined. In response to this, we
applied machine learning algorithms SVM and XGBoost, as well as Logistic
Regression, to construct a number of prediction models based on at-home
advertisement exposure time and demographic data, examining the predictability
of Actual Purchase and Purchase Intention behaviors of 3000 customers across 36
different products during the span of 3 months. If models based on exposure
time had unreliable predictability in contrast to models based on demographic
data, doubts would surface about the effectiveness of the hard investment in
television advertising. Based on our results, we found that models based on
advert exposure time were consistently low in their predictability in
comparison with models based on demographic data only, and with models based on
both demographic data and exposure time data. We also found that there was not
a statistically significant difference between these last two kinds of models.

"Despite the rapid development of adversarial machine learning, most adversarial attack and defense researches mainly focus on the perturbation-based adversarial examples, which is constrained by the input images. In comparison with existing works, we propose non-constrained adversarial examples, which are generated entirely from scratch without any constraint on the input. Unlike perturbation-based attacks, or the so-called unrestricted adversarial attack which is still constrained by the input noise, we aim to learn the distribution of adversarial examples to generate non-constrained but semantically meaningful adversarial examples. Following this spirit, we propose a novel attack framework called AT-GAN (Adversarial Transfer on Generative Adversarial Net). Specifically, we first develop a normal GAN model to learn the distribution of benign data, and then transfer the pre-trained GAN model to estimate the distribution of adversarial examples for the target model. In this way, AT-GAN can learn the distribution of adversarial examples that is very close to the distribution of real data. To our knowledge, this is the first work of building an adversarial generator model that could produce adversarial examples directly from any input noise. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that the proposed AT-GAN can very efficiently generate diverse adversarial examples that are more realistic to human perception. In addition, AT-GAN yields higher attack success rates against adversarially trained models under white-box attack setting and exhibits moderate transferability against black-box models.",are illustrated in Figure 5 and 6 Instead of adding perturbations to the original images AT GAN transfers the generator so that the generated adversarial instances are not in the same shape of the initial examples in diagonal generated by the original generator Table 6 The architectures of Models A through D and CNN used for classification After each model s name we put the number of parameters of that model Model A 3 382 346 Model B 710 218 Model C 4 795 082 Con v 64 5 5 Re lu Dropout 0 2 Con v 128 3 3 Re lu Con v 64 5 5 Re lu Con v 64 8 8 Re lu Con v 64 3 3 Re lu Dropout 0 25 Con v 128 6 6 Re lu Dropout 0 25 FC 128 Re lu Con v 128 5 5 Re lu FC 128 Re lu Dropout 0 5 Dropout 0 5 Droop out 0 5 FC 10 Soft max FC 10 Soft max FC 10 Soft max Model D 509 410 CNN 17 066 658 cid 20 cid 21 FC 300 Re lu Con v 32 3 3 Re lu 4 Dropout 0 5 Con v 32 3 3 Re lu Dropout 0 3 FC 10 Soft max Con v 64 3 3 Re lu Con v 64 3 3 Re lu Max pool 2 2 Dropout 0 3 Con v 128 3 3 Re lu Con v 128 3 3 Re lu Max pool 2 2 Dropout 0 3 FC 512 Re lu Dropout 0 3 FC 10 Soft max Table 7 Hyper paramters of different attack methods on the datasets Datasets Attack M NIST Fashion M NIST Ce leb A Norm F GSM cid 15 0 3 cid 15 0 1 cid 15 0 015 cid 96 PG D cid 15 0 3 0 075 epochs 20 cid 15 0 1 0 01 epochs 20 cid 15 0 015 0 005 epochs 20 cid 96 R F GSM cid 15 0 3 0 15 cid 15 0 2 0 1 cid 15 0 015 0 003 cid 96 Song s 100 0 epochs 200 100 0 epochs 200 100 100 epochs 200 N A,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Recently, deep learning has become a de facto standard in machine learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrating spectacular success on a wide variety of tasks. However, CNNs are typically very demanding computationally at inference time. One of the ways to alleviate this burden on certain hardware platforms is quantization relying on the use of low-precision arithmetic representation for the weights and the activations. Another popular method is the pruning of the number of filters in each layer. While mainstream deep learning methods train the neural networks weights while keeping the network architecture fixed, the emerging neural architecture search (NAS) techniques make the latter also amenable to training. In this paper, we formulate optimal arithmetic bit length allocation and neural network pruning as a NAS problem, searching for the configurations satisfying a computational complexity budget while maximizing the accuracy. We use a differentiable search method based on the continuous relaxation of the search space proposed by Liu et al. (arXiv:1806.09055). We show, by grid search, that heterogeneous quantized networks suffer from a high variance which renders the benefit of the search questionable.

"Distributed devices such as mobile phones can produce and store large amounts
of data that can enhance machine learning models; however, this data may
contain private information specific to the data owner that prevents the
release of the data. We wish to reduce the correlation between user-specific
private information and data while maintaining the useful information. Rather
than learning a large model to achieve privatization from end to end, we
introduce a decoupling of the creation of a latent representation and the
privatization of data that allows user-specific privatization to occur in a
distributed setting with limited computation and minimal disturbance on the
utility of the data. We leverage a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to create a
compact latent representation of the data; however, the VAE remains fixed for
all devices and all possible private labels. We then train a small generative
filter to perturb the latent representation based on individual preferences
regarding the private and utility information. The small filter is trained by
utilizing a GAN-type robust optimization that can take place on a distributed
device. We conduct experiments on three popular datasets: MNIST, UCI-Adult, and
CelebA, and give a thorough evaluation including visualizing the geometry of
the latent embeddings and estimating the empirical mutual information to show
the effectiveness of our approach.",We present the results of experiments on the datasets M NIST UCI adult and Ce leb A to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach M NIST Case 1 We consider the digit number itself as the private attribute and the digit containing a circle or not as the utility attribute Figure 1 shows samples of this case as introduced before Specific classification results before and after privatization are given in the form of confusion ma trice s in figures 3 a and 3 b demonstrating a significant reduction in private label classification accuracy These results are supported by our illustrations of the latent space geometry in Figure 4 via uniform manifold approximation and projection U MAP McInnes et al 2018 Specifically figure 4 b shows a clear separation between circle digits on the right and non circle digits on the left We also investigate the sensitivity of classification accuracy for both labels with respect to the distortion budget for KL divergence in Figure 3 c demonstrating that increasing the distortion budget rapidly decreases the private label accuracy while maintaining the utility label accuracy We also compare these results to a baseline method based on differential privacy an additive Gaussian mechanism discussed in section 6 3 and we find that this additive Gaussian mechanism performs worse than our generative adversarial filter in terms of keeping the utility and protecting the private labels because the Gaussian mechanism yields lower utility and worse privacy i e higher prediction accuracy of private labels than them in max generative filter approach a raw b privatized c classification accuracy Figure 3 Classifying digits in M NIST Original digits can be easily classified with more than 90 accuracy on average yet the new perturbed digits have a significantly lower accuracy as expected Specifically many circle digits are incorrectly classified as other circle digits and similarly for the non circle digits Figure 3 c demonstrates that classification accuracy on the private label decreases quickly while classification on the utility label remains nearly constant as the distortion budget increases Furthermore our approach is superior to the baseline Gaussian mechanism based on differential privacy M NIST Case 2 This case has the same setting as the experiment given in Reza ei et al 2018 where we consider odd or even digits as the target utility and large or small value 5 as the private label Rather than training a generator based on a fixed class i fier as done in Reza ei et al 2018 we take a different modeling and evaluation approach that allows the adversarial class i fier to update dynamically We find that the classification accuracy of the private attribute drops down from 95 to 65 as the distortion budget grows Meanwhile our generative filter doesn t deteriorate the target utility too much which maintains a classification accuracy above 87 for the utility label as the distortion increases as shown in figure 7 b We discuss more results in the appendix section 6 6 together with results verifying the reduction of mutual information between the data and the private labels While using the privatization scheme from case 2 we measure the classification accuracy of the c ir cle attribute from case 1 This test show the distortion budget prevents excessive loss of information of non target attributes The circle attribute from case 1 is not included in the loss function when training for case 2 however as seen in Table 1 the classification accuracy on the circle is not more diminished than the target attribute odd A more detailed plot of the classification accuracy can be,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Since the advent of the horseshoe priors for regularization, global-local shrinkage methods have proved to be a fertile ground for the development of Bayesian methodology in machine learning, specifically for high-dimensional regression and classification problems. They have achieved remarkable success in computation, and enjoy strong theoretical support. Most of the existing literature has focused on the linear Gaussian case; see Bhadra et al. (2019b) for a systematic survey. The purpose of the current article is to demonstrate that the horseshoe regularization is useful far more broadly, by reviewing both methodological and computational developments in complex models that are more relevant to machine learning applications. Specifically, we focus on methodological challenges in horseshoe regularization in nonlinear and non-Gaussian models; multivariate models; and deep neural networks. We also outline the recent computational developments in horseshoe shrinkage for complex models along with a list of available software implementations that allows one to venture out beyond the comfort zone of the canonical linear regression problems.",and computational strategies developed for the horseshoe in linear models what light could one shed then on the current state of the art in global local shrinkage in nonlinear non Gaussian models The article is organized as follows The remainder of Section 1 provides a brief historical overview of regular iz ation dating back to the work of Stein 1956 Section 2 points out the critical differences between global and global local regular iz ation approaches in linear Gaussian models Given this background we proceed to the main focus area of our article the current state of global local regular iz ation beyond linear Gaussian models While both Sections 3 and 4 focus on these issues we reserve the discussion of horseshoe shrinkage in shallow models for the former and their more recent emerging uses in deep models for the latter Section 5 describes the comp u tat ional aspects of horseshoe shrinkage along with available software implementations in complex and deep models Section 6 concludes with some possible directions for future research 1 1 Regular iz ation from a Bayesian perspective Many penalized optimization problems in statistics are of the form arg min l y Rn where l y is a measure of fit of parameter to data y also known as the empirical risk is a penalty function and is a tuning parameter Let p y exp l y and p exp where p is a generic density If l y is proportional to the negative of the log likelihood function under a suitable model one arrives at a Bayesian interpretation to the regular iz ation problem that of finding the mode of the posterior density p y under prior density p Pols on and Scott 2016 The prior need not necessarily be proper but the posterior p y p y p may still be proper This provides an equivalence between regular iz ation and Bayesian methods Common examples include the equivalence between ridge penalty and a Gaussian prior or the lasso penalty and a double exponential prior when used in conjunction with a Gaussian likelihood which corresponds to a squared error loss We distinguish among the three following estimators throughout the paper,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) are popular machine learning algorithms with implementations such as LightGBM and in popular machine learning toolkits like Scikit-Learn. Many implementations can only produce trees in an offline manner and in a greedy manner. We explore ways to convert existing GBDT implementations to known neural network architectures with minimal performance loss in order to allow decision splits to be updated in an online manner and provide extensions to allow splits points to be altered as a neural architecture search problem. We provide learning bounds for our neural network.,shown in tables 1 and 2 are when all weights are re initial is e to random values For our boosted trees we use an Ensemble of 100 trees for all datasets and boosted tree implementations Table 1 Kendall s Tau of Tree Grad and LG M and GB T Feature Importance Split Metric Larger values mean more similar Decision Tree Boosted Trees 100 Trees LG M GB TL GM GB T adult 0 10 0 33 0 48 0 47 cov type 0 22 0 33 0 45 0 44 dna 0 12 0 13 0 06 0 28 glass 0 34 0 07 0 17 0 11 mandel on 0 54 0 59 0 05 0 07 soybean 0 08 0 21 0 05 0 05 yeast 0 47 0 28 0 47 0 6 When comparing the diversity in features which are selected we notice that greedy methods being LG M and GB T generally select similar kinds of features However in some instances our non greedy approach select es different kinds of features which can be observed in the adult data set when considering a single Decision Tree as shown in Table 1 When we consider the boosting approaches as there are more trees which are build and hence more split candidates the Transferring Tree Ensembles to Neural Networks 9 level of agreement changes in distribution What is interesting is the three datasets with the lowest amount of agreement DNA mandel on soybean with our Tree Grad approach actually performs the best against the test data set as shown in Table 2 which suggests that our Tree Grad algorithm has managed to find some relationships which greedy approaches may have missed Table 2 Accuracy Performance of Tree Grad against LG M and GB T Test Data set Larger values means better performance Decision Tree Boosted Trees 100 Trees Data set Tree Grad LG M GB T Tree Grad LG M GB T adult 0 797 0 765 0 7590 860 0 873 0 874 cov type 0 644 0 731 0 7030 832 0 835 0 826 dna 0 850 0 5410 8910 950 0 949 0 946 glass 0 688 0 422 0 5940 766 0 813 0 719 mandel on 0 789 0 752 0 7660 882 0 881 0 866 soybean 0 662 0 5830 8920 936 0 936 0 917 yeast 0 553 0 364 0 5170 591 0 573 0 542 Number of wins 4 1 24 3 1 Mean Reciprocal Rank 0 762 0 452 0 6190 762 0 714 0 429 We also compare the comparison of all three approaches against the test datasets as shown in Table 2 Overall the best performing model is our approach Tree Grad Tree Grad s performance is a demonstration that non greedy ap p roaches can fall back to representations similar to greedy approaches which is competitive with existing greedy algorithms or discover representations which can not be recovered by greedy approaches We observe that for boosting ap p roaches LG M has very similar performance compared with Tree Grad whereas GB T performance begins to fall off compared with its strong performance when considering the single Decision Tree,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"PURPOSE: The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing
exponentially. Clinicians need tools monitoring and prioritizing the literature
to understand the clinical implications of the pathogenic genetic variants. We
developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as
relevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or
prevalence of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature
searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an
annotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine learning
classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which
learns a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each
title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN)
which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule based on the raw title and
abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification
of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance
classification, we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60% for
training the model, 20% for tuning the model, and 20% for evaluating the model.
The SVM model achieves 89.53% accuracy (percentage of papers that were
correctly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.95 % accuracy. For
prevalence classification, we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The
SVM model achieves 89.14% accuracy while the CNN model achieves 89.13 %
accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts
as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review,
this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning
knowledge of gene-cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical
decision support tools up to date.",For pen e trance classification we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60 for training the model 20 for tuning the model and 20 for evaluating the

clinical decision support tools up to date INTRODUCTION The medical literature is growing exponentially and nowhere is this more apparent than in genetics In 2010 a PubMed search for B RCA 1 yielded 7 867 papers while in 2017 the same search retrieved nearly double that amount 14 266 papers As the literature about individual genes increases so does the number of pathogenic gene variants that are clinically actionable Panel testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility genes identifies many patients with pathogenic variants in genes that are less familiar to clinicians and it is not feasible for clinicians to understand the clinical implications of these pathogenic variants by conducting their own comprehensive literature review Thus clinicians need help monitoring collating and prioritizing the medical literature In addition clinicians need clinical decision support tools to help facilitate decision making for patients These tools depend on a knowledge base of the metadata on these genetic mutations that is both up to date and comprehensive 1 Natural language processing NLP is an area of Artificial Intelligence A I that focuses on problems involving the interpretation and understanding of free text by a non human system 2 3 Traditional NLP approaches have relied almost exclusively on rules based systems where domain experts pre define a set of rules used to identify text with specific content However defining these rules is laborious and challenging as a result of variations in language format and syntax 4 Modern NLP approaches instead rely on machine learning where predictive models are learned directly from a set of texts that have been annotated for the specific target NLP has been applied in fields relevant to medical and health research 2 5 6 For example in the field of oncology researchers have used NLP to identify and classify cancer patients assign staging and determine cancer recurrence 7 9 NLP also has an important role in accelerating literature review by classifying papers as relevant to the topic of interest 10 11 Several studies developed and improved machine learning approaches based on the publicly available literature collections of 15 systematic literature reviews 11 14 These reviews were conducted by the Evidence based Practice Centers to evaluate the efficacy of medications in 15 drug categories 13 F runz a et al used a complement na ve Bayes approach to identify papers on the topic of the dissemination strategy of health care services for elderly people and achieved a precision of 63 15 F is z man et al proposed an approach to identify papers relevant to cardiovascular risk factors 56 recall 91 precision 16 Miwa et al extended an existing approach to classify social and public health literature on topics of cooking skills sanitation tobacco packaging and youth development 17 However no NLP approaches have been developed specifically for classifying literature regarding the pen e trance risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers or prevalence of germline genetic mutations To our knowledge no annotated data set is available for the purpose of developing a machine learning method to identify relevant papers in this domain In this study we aimed to create a human annotated data set of abstracts on cancer susceptibility genes and develop a machine learning based NLP approach to classify abstracts as relevant to the pen e trance or prevalence of pathogenic genetic mutations MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional Review Board approval was not needed as no human data were analyzed Establishing an annotated data set To develop effective machine learning models for automatic identification of relevant papers we created a human annotated data set We performed PubMed searches using the following query templates gene name TIA B OR medical subject headings MeSH for that gene OR related syndrome name TIA B OR MeSH for that syndrome AND Risk Mesh OR Risk TI OR Pen e trance TIA B OR Hazard ratio TIA B AND cancer name Mesh OR cancer name TIA B gene name TIA B OR medical subject headings MeSH for that gene OR related syndrome name TIA B OR MeSH for that syndrome We considered different gene cancer combinations from the All Syndrome Known to Man Eva lu at or ASK 2 ME 18 a recently developed clinical decision support tool for clinicians to estimate the age specific cancer risk of germline mutation carriers This tool captures most of the important gene cancer combinations We opted to use the title and abstract of each paper as the input for our models for three main reasons First this information can be automatically downloaded through E Direct 19 whereas automatically downloading the full text papers was not feasible due to licensing issues Second the title and abstract of each paper can be downloaded in free text form whereas full text papers are not generally available in a common format and one needs to handle PDF HTML as well as others Last but not least annotating the title and abstract is less time consuming than annotating the full text and therefore obtaining a large training data set is feasible Each paper based on title and abstract was annotated for the following fields by six human an not at or s with a minimum of two human an not at or s per paper Two fields pen e trance and prevalence were used to classify papers as relevant to pen e trance prevalence both or neither Other fields polymorphism ambiguous pen e trance ambiguous incidence were annotated and used as exclusion criteria Pen e trance presence of information about risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers Prevalence presence of information about proportion of germline mutation carriers in the general population or among individuals with cancer Polymorphism presence of information only on a germline genetic variant present in more than 1 of the general population Ambiguous pen e trance a unresolved disagreement between human an not at or s on the pen e trance label or b impossibility of determining the pen e trance label solely based on the title and the abstract Ambiguous prevalence a unresolved disagreement between human an not at or s on the prevalence label or b impossibility of determining the prevalence label solely based on the title and the abstract Our goal was to develop models that could accurately classify papers with subject matter pertaining to the pen e trance and prevalence of rare germline mutations Papers annotated as polymorphism or ambiguous were not used for model training tuning or evaluation Models Our first model is a support vector machine SVM We first token i zed the input title and abstract and converted them into a standard bag of n gram vector representation Specifically we represented each title and abstract by a vector where in each entry is the term frequency inverse document frequency t f idf of the corresponding n gram T f idf increases in proportion to the frequency of the n gram in this particular abstract and is offset by the frequency of the n gram in the entire data set Thus the resulting representation serves to down weight the feature value of common words that add little information such as articles Finally we used this bag of n gram representation as the input for a linear S VMs to predict its corresponding label Our second model is a convolutional neural network CNN 20 This model directly takes the token i zed title and abstract as its input and con vol ves the input with learn able local filters It then combines the con vol ved representation globally and predicts the final label Unlike the linear SVM the CNN model is capable of learning nonlinear decision rules Model Evaluation For both the pen e trance and the prevalence classification task we split the data set randomly into a model training set 60 of the data a model tuning set 20 of the data and a model evaluation 20 of the data We trained the two models on the training set and used the model tuning set for hyper parameter selection The model performance was evaluated on the model evaluation set We used accuracy percentage of the papers that were correctly classified and F 1 score as our evaluation metrics Here the F 1 score is the harmonic mean of precision percent of predicted positive that are true positive and recall percent of all true positives that are predicted as positive Learning curves were constructed showing how the number of papers annotated in the training set affects the accuracy of the models We also plotted the receiver operating characteristic curve ROC curve to compare the model performance at various thresholds RESULTS Data set The final human annotated data set contained 3 919 annotated papers Table 1 Of these 989 were on pen e trance and 1291 were on prevalence We excluded papers that were labeled as polymorphism related For the task of pen e trance classification we further excluded papers with an ambiguous pen e trance label reducing the annotated data set to 3740 For the task of prevalence classification we excluded papers with ambiguous prevalence label reducing the annotated data set to 3753 Table 1 Model Performance Table 2 shows the performance of the SVM and CNN model The SVM model achieves 0 8953 accuracy and 0 7886 F 1 score in pen e trance classification and 0 8914 accuracy and 0 8396 F 1 score in prevalence classification Although the CNN has more flexibility in modeling it under performs by a small margin compared to the SVM model Figures 1 a and 1 b show the receiver operating characteristic curve ROC curve of the two models for pen e trance and prevalence classification respectively The y axis is the true positive rate which is also known as sensitivity or recall The x axis is the false positive rate which represents the probability of false alarm The ROC curve provides a comparison of the model performance at different levels of decision threshold Both models achieved similar area under the ROC curve A UC for both classification tasks Figures 2 a and 2 b depict the learning curves for the two models for pen e trance and prevalence classification respectively For pen e trance classification when only 500 annotated papers are used for training the SVM model achieved around 0 89 accuracy while the CNN model achieves less than 0 85 accuracy However the learning curve of the CNN model improves steadily as the training set increases For prevalence classification the two learning curves show a flattening trend after the number of papers reaches,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

"Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are commonly leveraged by malware to create lists of domain names which can be used for command and control (C&C) purposes. Approaches based on machine learning have recently been developed to automatically detect generated domain names in real-time. In this work, we present a novel DGA called CharBot which is capable of producing large numbers of unregistered domain names that are not detected by state-of-the-art classifiers for real-time detection of DGAs, including the recently published methods FANCI (a random forest based on human-engineered features) and LSTM.MI (a deep learning approach). CharBot is very simple, effective and requires no knowledge of the targeted DGA classifiers. We show that retraining the classifiers on CharBot samples is not a viable defense strategy. We believe these findings show that DGA classifiers are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks if they rely only on the domain name string to make a decision. Designing a robust DGA classifier may, therefore, necessitate the use of additional information besides the domain name alone.

"Graphs are a natural abstraction for many problems where nodes represent entities and edges represent a relationship across entities. An important area of research that has emerged over the last decade is the use of graphs as a vehicle for non-linear dimensionality reduction in a manner akin to previous efforts based on manifold learning with uses for downstream database processing, machine learning and visualization. In this systematic yet comprehensive experimental survey, we benchmark several popular network representation learning methods operating on two key tasks: link prediction and node classification. We examine the performance of 12 unsupervised embedding methods on 15 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the scale of our study -- both in terms of the number of methods and number of datasets -- is the largest to date. Our results reveal several key insights about work-to-date in this space. First, we find that certain baseline methods (task-specific heuristics, as well as classic manifold methods) that have often been dismissed or are not considered by previous efforts can compete on certain types of datasets if they are tuned appropriately. Second, we find that recent methods based on matrix factorization offer a small but relatively consistent advantage over alternative methods (e.g., random-walk based methods) from a qualitative standpoint. Specifically, we find that MNMF, a community preserving embedding method, is the most competitive method for the link prediction task. While NetMF is the most competitive baseline for node classification. Third, no single method completely outperforms other embedding methods on both node classification and link prediction tasks.

"Meta-learning is a tool that allows us to build sample-efficient learning systems. Here we show that, once meta-trained, LSTM Meta-Learners aren't just faster learners than their sample-inefficient deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) brethren, but that they actually pursue fundamentally different learning trajectories. We study their learning dynamics on three sets of structured tasks for which the corresponding learning dynamics of DL and RL systems have been previously described: linear regression (Saxe et al., 2013), nonlinear regression (Rahaman et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018), and contextual bandits (Schaul et al., 2019). In each case, while sample-inefficient DL and RL Learners uncover the task structure in a staggered manner, meta-trained LSTM Meta-Learners uncover almost all task structure concurrently, congruent with the patterns expected from Bayes-optimal inference algorithms.

"At present, different deep learning models are presenting high accuracy on popular inference datasets such as SNLI, MNLI, and SciTail. However, there are different indicators that those datasets can be exploited by using some simple linguistic patterns. This fact poses difficulties to our understanding of the actual capacity of machine learning models to solve the complex task of textual inference. We propose a new set of syntactic tasks focused on contradiction detection that require specific capacities over linguistic logical forms such as: Boolean coordination, quantifiers, definite description, and counting operators. We evaluate two kinds of deep learning models that implicitly exploit language structure: recurrent models and the Transformer network BERT. We show that although BERT is clearly more efficient to generalize over most logical forms, there is space for improvement when dealing with counting operators. Since the syntactic tasks can be implemented in different languages, we show a successful case of cross-lingual transfer learning between English and Portuguese.",How the different models perform on

"We present a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for predicting whether an active region (AR) would produce a gamma-class flare within the next 24 hours. We consider three gamma classes, namely >=M5.0 class, >=M class, and >=C class, and build three LSTM models separately, each corresponding to a gamma class. Each LSTM model is used to make predictions of its corresponding gamma-class flares. The essence of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use LSTMs to capture temporal information of the data samples. Each data sample has 40 features including 25 magnetic parameters obtained from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and related data products as well as 15 flare history parameters. We survey the flare events that occurred from 2010 May to 2018 May, using the GOES X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and select flares with identified ARs in the NCEI flare catalogs. These flare events are used to build the labels (positive vs. negative) of the data samples. Experimental results show that (i) using only 14-22 most important features including both flare history and magnetic parameters can achieve better performance than using all the 40 features together; (ii) our LSTM network outperforms related machine learning methods in predicting the labels of the data samples. To our knowledge, this is the first time that LSTMs have been used for solar flare prediction.",AND CONCLUSIONS We develop a long short term memory LSTM network to predict whether an AR would produce a class flare within the next 24 hours We consider three classes namely M 5 0 class M class and C class and build three LSTM models separately each corresponding to a class Each LSTM model is used to make predictions of its corresponding class flares We build a data set containing the data in the period from 2010 May to 2018 May gathered from the J SOC website Each sample in the data set has 40 features including 25 magnetic parameters Predicting Solar Flares Using a Long Short Term Memory Network 17 a RF S SP b RF ROC c RF RD d LSTM S SP e LSTM ROC f LSTM RD Figure 10 Comparison between RF top and LSTM bottom for C class flare prediction where the corresponding S SP ROC and RD are displayed from left to right provided by SHARP and related data products as well as 15 flare history parameters We divide the data set into three subsets the subset covering 2010 2013 for training the subset covering 2014 for validation and the subset covering 2015 2018 for testing The training subset and testing subset are disjoint and hence our proposed method will make prediction sonARs that it has never seen before With extensive experiments we evaluate the performance of all three LSTM models and compare them with closely related machine learning methods using different performance metrics The main results are summarized as follows,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"We use ensemble machine learning algorithms to study the evolution of magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence that is helically forced. We perform direct numerical simulations of helically forced turbulence using mean field formalism, with electromotive force (EMF) modeled both as a linear and non-linear function of the mean magnetic field and current density. The form of the EMF is determined using regularized linear regression and random forests. We also compare various analytical models to the data using Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Our results demonstrate that linear regression is largely successful at predicting the EMF and the use of more sophisticated algorithms (random forests, MCMC) do not lead to significant improvement in the fits.

"Learning on data represented with multiple views (e.g., multiple types of descriptors or modalities) is a rapidly growing direction in machine learning and computer vision.

Differently, in this paper, we focus on unsupervised representation learning and propose a novel framework termed Autoencoder in Autoencoder Networks (AE^2-Nets), which integrates information from heterogeneous sources into an intact representation by the nested autoencoder framework. The proposed method has the following merits: (1) our model jointly performs view-specific representation learning (with the inner autoencoder networks) and multi-view information encoding (with the outer autoencoder networks) in a unified framework; (2) due to the degradation process from the latent representation to each single view, our model flexibly balances the complementarity and consistence among multiple views.

"Graph neural networks have become one of the most important techniques to solve machine learning problems on graph-structured data. Recent work on vertex classification proposed deep and distributed learning models to achieve high performance and scalability. However, we find that the feature vectors of benchmark datasets are already quite informative for the classification task, and the graph structure only provides a means to denoise the data. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework based on graph signal processing for analyzing graph neural networks. Our results indicate that graph neural networks only perform low-pass filtering on feature vectors and do not have the non-linear manifold learning property.

"Machine learning methods often need a large amount of labeled training data. Since the training data is assumed to be the ground truth, outliers can severely degrade learned representations and performance of trained models. Here we apply concepts from robust statistics to derive a novel variational autoencoder that is robust to outliers in the training data. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) extract a lower-dimensional encoded feature representation from which we can generate new data samples. Robustness of autoencoders to outliers is critical for generating a reliable representation of particular data types in the encoded space when using corrupted training data. Our robust VAE is based on beta-divergence rather than the standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Our proposed lower bound lead to a RVAE model that has the same computational complexity as the VAE and contains a single tuning parameter to control the degree of robustness. We demonstrate the performance of our $\beta$-divergence based autoencoder for a range of image datasets, showing improved robustness to outliers both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also illustrate the use of our robust VAE for outlier detection.",show that outlier images are encoded when VAE is used On the other hand our RVAE did not encode the outlier noise images and encoded them to produce images consistent with theM NIST training data Moreover we visually inspected the embedding s using both VAE and RVAE Figure 2 a d In the VAE case Figure 2 a and b the distributions of the digits were strongly perturbed by the outlier noise images In contrast RVAE was not significantly affected by outliers Figure 2 c and d illustrating the robustness of our RVAE Reconstruction from Gaussian noise Generated samples from the decoder 0 0003 0 0005 0 0007 0 0009 Figure 6 Searching for best by visual inspection we compare the reconstructed images of the fake outliers generated by Gaussian noise with the generated samples The optimal value of is 0 0007 since the reconstructed images and the generated samples look more similar and there is a variability in generated samples This optimal value also matches the maximum value achieved in the heat map in Figure 4 b t up nI E AV E AVR a b t up nI E AV E AVR c t up nI E AV E AVR Figure 7 Reconstructions of brain images using VAE and RVAE a after randomly dropping rows with a height of 5 pixels for 10 of the Maryland MagNeTs data set b after adding random lesion to 10 percent of the Maryland MagNeTs data set c on the IS EL data with true lesions Unlike VAE both simulated and real outliers are not reconstructed by the RVAE,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) has achieved great progress in many real-life applications. Meanwhile, due to the complex model structures against strict latency and memory restriction, the implementation of CNN models on the resource-limited platforms is becoming more challenging. This work proposes a solution, called CompactNet\footnote{Project URL: \url{https://github.com/CompactNet/CompactNet}}, which automatically optimizes a pre-trained CNN model on a specific resource-limited platform given a specific target of inference speedup. Guided by a simulator of the target platform, CompactNet progressively trims a pre-trained network by removing certain redundant filters until the target speedup is reached and generates an optimal platform-specific model while maintaining the accuracy. We evaluate our work on two platforms of a mobile ARM CPU and a machine learning accelerator NPU (Cambricon-1A ISA) on a Huawei Mate10 smartphone. For the state-of-the-art slim CNN model made for the embedded platform, MobileNetV2, CompactNet achieves up to a 1.8x kernel computation speedup with equal or even higher accuracy for image classification tasks on the Cifar-10 dataset.",than other optimizing approaches on both mo bile CPU and theN PU accelerator On the other hand Compact Net maintains accuracy with such speedup and can even slightly improve it if the speedup target is less aggressive Mobile CPU We set two different speedup targets and the results are shown in Table 5 Our Compact Net achieves higher accuracy with a 1 5 x speedup compared with the original MobileNetV2 and maintains the accuracy with up to a 1 8 x speedup We also compare with some state of the art counterparts including Ne t Adapt Yan get al 2018 Morph Net Gordon et al 2018 and ADC He and Han 2018 on the same Ci far 10 data set and our Compact Net outperforms them in terms of both speedup and accuracy than those works Compared with the original MobileNetV2 model the number of filters in each layer of the opt i mal models are shown in Figure 4 N PU Accelerator Since other works are not specifically designed for theN PUp lat form they cannot achieve the same speedup as that on the mo bile CPU platform In contrast our Compact Net can still gene r ate optimal models for theN PU The results are shown in Table 6 and the number of filters per layer in optimal models compared with the original MobileNetV2 are shown in Figure 5 These results can also give us some interesting insight about the CNN model itself For example the original MobileNetV2 has an incremental filters architecture among the layers However s re tl iF fo reb muN Layer Original MobileNetV2 Compact Net with 1 5 x Speedup on Compact Net with 1 8 x Speedup on 100 CPU CPU Figure 4 Number of filters per layer in the original MobileNetV2 and optimal models for mobile CPU generated by Compact Net Optimizing Approach T Top 1 final Accuracy Original MobileNetV2 100 1 0 x 71 98 Net Adapt Yan get al 2018 1 2 x 70 63 Morph Net Gordon et al 2018 1 1 x 69 87 ADC He and Han 2018 1 1 x 69 51 Compact Net on N PU 1 3 x 72 56 1 5 x 71 68 Table 6 Final speedup T and accuracy results of Compact Net final deployed on the N PU accelerator compared with the original MobileNetV2 and other works Original MobileNetV2 32 16 24 24 32 32 32 64 64 64 Compact Net with 1 3 x Speedup on N PU 32 10 24 24 32 32 32 22 22 22 Compact Net with 1 5 x Speedup on N PU 32 10 12 12 16 16 16 12 12 12,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"There have been increasing challenges to solve combinatorial optimization problems by machine learning. Khalil et al. proposed an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework, S2V-DQN, which automatically learns graph embeddings to construct solutions to a wide range of problems. To improve the generalization ability of their Q-learning method, we propose a novel learning strategy based on AlphaGo Zero which is a Go engine that achieved a superhuman level without the domain knowledge of the game. Our framework is redesigned for combinatorial problems, where the final reward might take any real number instead of a binary response, win/lose. In experiments conducted for five kinds of NP-hard problems including {\sc MinimumVertexCover} and {\sc MaxCut}, our method is shown to generalize better to various graphs than S2V-DQN. Furthermore, our method can be combined with recently-developed graph neural network (GNN) models such as the \emph{Graph Isomorphism Network}, resulting in even better performance.

"Neural program embedding can be helpful in analyzing large software, a task that is challenging for traditional logic-based program analyses due to their limited scalability. A key focus of recent machine-learning advances in this area is on modeling program semantics instead of just syntax. Unfortunately evaluating such advances is not obvious, as program semantics does not lend itself to straightforward metrics. In this paper, we introduce a benchmarking framework called COSET for standardizing the evaluation of neural program embeddings. COSET consists of a diverse dataset of programs in source-code format, labeled by human experts according to a number of program properties of interest. A point of novelty is a suite of program transformations included in COSET. These transformations when applied to the base dataset can simulate natural changes to program code due to optimization and refactoring and can serve as a ""debugging"" tool for classification mistakes. We conducted a pilot study on four prominent models: TreeLSTM, gated graph neural network (GGNN), AST-Path neural network (APNN), and DYPRO. We found that COSET is useful in identifying the strengths and limitations of each model and in pinpointing specific syntactic and semantic characteristics of programs that pose challenges.",than static models which have difficulties in capturing the program semantics As a result static models are much less stable against the syntax variations even when the semantics are preserved On the other hand the generalization from static program features as done in GG NN and AP NN while insufficiently accurate is scalable to large or long running programs which overwhelm the dynamic model of DY PRO Through careful use of CO SET s debugging features we then identify a number of specific shortcomings in the tested models from lack of support for variable types to confusion about logging and other ancillary program aspects and to limitations in representing APIs We make the following contributions We design CO SET a novel benchmark framework that expresses both human and algorithmic variations in software artifacts We propose CO SET for evaluating how precise the models can learn to interpret the programs e m antics and for identifying specific program characteristics that are the source of mis classification We present our evaluation results including the strength and weakness of each model followed by an in depth discussion of our findings,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Graph convolution network based approaches have been recently used to model region-wise relationships in region-level prediction problems in urban computing. Each relationship represents a kind of spatial dependency, like region-wise distance or functional similarity. To incorporate multiple relationships into spatial feature extraction, we define the problem as a multi-modal machine learning problem on multi-graph convolution networks. Leveraging the advantage of multi-modal machine learning, we propose to develop modality interaction mechanisms for this problem, in order to reduce generalization error by reinforcing the learning of multimodal coordinated representations. In this work, we propose two interaction techniques for handling features in lower layers and higher layers respectively. In lower layers, we propose grouped GCN to combine the graph connectivity from different modalities for more complete spatial feature extraction. In higher layers, we adapt multi-linear relationship networks to GCN by exploring the dimension transformation and freezing part of the covariance structure. The adapted approach, called multi-linear relationship GCN, learns more generalized features to overcome the train-test divergence induced by time shifting. We evaluated our model on ridehailing demand forecasting problem using two real-world datasets. The proposed technique outperforms state-of-the art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy, training efficiency, interpretability and model robustness.",for a high rank output feature matrix so that the co adaptation problem is alleviated and model generality is increased In this section we compare our graph interaction techniques with state of the art baselines on region level demand forecasting for ride hailing service Multi modality fusion The final layer is the modality fusion layer in order to aggregate Data set features from different modalities and output a prediction result We conduct our experiments on two real world large scale ride For one steps patio temporal prediction problem the output shape is hailing datasets collected in two cities City A and City B 5 Both R V 1 The design of modality fusion is straightforward First we of the datasets were collected in main city zone in 2017 We split make sure the last MR GCN layer reduces the feature dimension to data to training set Mar 1 st to Jul 31 st 2017 validation set Aug 1 Then the modality fusion layer is designed as an modality wise 1 st to Oct 31 th 2017 and test set Nov 1 st to Dec 31 st 2017 The average POI data used for AS contains 13 primary categories including business building residential building entertainments etc The Ol 1 1 cid 213 M Xl Xl R V 1 r a o n a d d s n u e b t w w a o y rk da d t a a t s a e u t s f e ro d m fo O rA pe C nS is tr e e,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Ensemble learning use multiple algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than any single one of its constituent algorithms could. With growing popularity of deep learning, researchers have started to ensemble them for various purposes. Few if any, however, has used the deep learning approach as a means to ensemble algorithms. This paper presents a deep ensemble learning framework which aims to harness deep learning algorithms to integrate multisource data and tap the wisdom of experts. At the voting layer, a sparse autoencoder is trained for feature learning to reduce the correlation of attributes and diversify the base classifiers ultimately. At the stacking layer, a nonlinear feature-weighted method based on deep belief networks is proposed to rank the base classifiers which may violate the conditional independence. Neural network is used as meta classifier. At the optimizing layer, under-sampling and threshold-moving are used to cope with cost-sensitive problem. Optimized predictions are obtained based on ensemble of probabilistic predictions by similarity calculation. The proposed deep ensemble learning framework is used for Alzheimers disease classification. Experiments with the clinical dataset from national Alzheimers coordinating center demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our proposed framework is 4% better than 6 well-known ensemble approaches as well as the standard stacking algorithm.

"Detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from neuroimaging data such as MRI through machine learning has been a subject of intense research in recent years. Recent success of deep learning in computer vision has progressed such research further. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where the state-of-the-art VGG architecture is initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where only a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink the training data size, we employ image entropy to select the most informative slices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show that with training size of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other contemporary methods, we reach state-of-the-art performance in AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC classification problems, with a 4% and a 7% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide detailed analysis of the effect of the intelligent training data selection method, changing the training size, and changing the number of layers to be fine-tuned.

"In conventional prediction tasks, a machine learning algorithm outputs a single best model that globally optimizes its objective function, which typically is accuracy. Therefore, users cannot access the other models explicitly. In contrast to this, multiple model enumeration attracts increasing interests in non-standard machine learning applications where other criteria, e.g., interpretability or fairness, than accuracy are main concern and a user may want to access more than one non-optimal, but suitable models. In this paper, we propose a K-best model enumeration algorithm for Support Vector Machines (SVM) that given a dataset S and an integer K>0, enumerates the K-best models on S with distinct support vectors in the descending order of the objective function values in the dual SVM problem. Based on analysis of the lattice structure of support vectors, our algorithm efficiently finds the next best model with small latency.

"Incremental gradient (IG) methods, such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants are commonly used for large scale optimization in machine learning. Despite the sustained effort to make IG methods more data-efficient, it remains an open question how to select a training data subset that can theoretically and practically perform on par with the full dataset. Here we develop CRAIG, a method to select a weighted subset (or coreset) of training data that closely estimates the full gradient by maximizing a submodular function. We prove that applying IG to this subset is guaranteed to converge to the (near)optimal solution with the same convergence rate as that of IG for convex optimization. As a result, CRAIG achieves a speedup that is inversely proportional to the size of the subset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous method for data-efficient training of general machine learning models. Our extensive set of experiments show that CRAIG, while achieving practically the same solution, speeds up various IG methods by up to 6x for logistic regression and 3x for training deep neural networks.",we report the run time as the w W k Pi V i f w Then for the iterates w w k wall clock time for subset selection with CRAIG plus min Pj S j j k k 0 generated by applying IG to S with per epoch step size imi zing the loss using IGor other optimizer s with the spec k with 0 and 0 1 we have if i ed learning rates For the classification problems we sep k arat ely select subsets from each class while maintaining the i if 1 then w w 2 Cr 2 k class ratios in the whole data and apply IG to the union of k k k max the subsets Note that the upper bounds on the gradient ii if 0 1 then w k w 2 fork differences derived in Appendix B 1 only hold for points k k with similar labels Thus theoretically we need to select iii if 0 then w w 1 k w w k k k k 0 k subsets separately For neural networks we observed that 2 Cr 2 max separately selecting subsets from each class helps the per form ance We separately tune each method so that it per where n is the sum of gradient Lipschitz con Pi 1 i forms at its best st ants of the component functions The above theorem shows that for 0 IG applied to S 5 1 Convex Experiments converges to a 2 neighborhood of the optimal solution In our convex experiments we apply CRAIG to SGD with a rate of 1 k which is the same convergence rate as well as SV RG Johnson Zhang 2013 and SAGA O for IG on the entire data set V As shown in our ex peri Def a zio et al 2014 We apply L 2 regularized logistic re ment s in real datasets small weighted subsets constructed gres sion f i x ln 1 exp w Tx i y i 0 5 w Tw by CRAIG provide a close approximation to the full gradi to classify the following two datasets from LIB SVM 1 ent Hence applying IG to the weighted subsets returned cov type binary including 581 012 data points of 54 di men by CRAIG provides a solution of the same or higher qu al s ions and 2 Ij CNN 1 including 49 990 training and 91 701 it y compared to the solution obtained by applying IG to the test data points of 22 dimensions As cov type does not whole data set in a considerably shorter amount of time come with labeled test data we randomly split the train ing data into halves to make the training test split training and set sets are consistent for different methods,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Motivated by the necessity for parameter efficiency in distributed machine learning and AI-enabled edge devices, we provide a general and easy to implement method for significantly reducing the number of parameters of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), during both the training and inference phases. We introduce a simple auxiliary neural network which can generate the convolutional filters of any CNN architecture from a low dimensional latent space. This auxiliary neural network, which we call ""Convolutional Slice Generator"" (CSG), is unique to the network and provides the association between its convolutional layers. During the training of the CNN, instead of training the filters of the convolutional layers, only the parameters of the CSG and their corresponding ""code vectors"" are trained. This results in a significant reduction of the number of parameters due to the fact that the CNN can be fully represented using only the parameters of the CSG, the code vectors, the fully connected layers, and the architecture of the CNN. We evaluate our approach by applying it to ResNet and DenseNet models when trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. While reducing the number of parameters by $\approx 2 \times$ on average, the accuracies of these networks remain within 1$\%$ of their original counterparts and in some cases there is an increase in the accuracy.",As we can see when we used 16 16 3 3 slices and code vectors of size 128 for ResNet 56 12 we achieved 2 5 reduction with less than 1 increase in top 1 error If we allow a higher accuracy degradation of 1 5 we can achieve over 5 3 parameter reduction by using 12 12 3 3 slices and code vectors of size 72 In case of DenseNet 13 we considered the most challenging cases namely when bottlenecks are used and the network has a 50 compression factor i e 0 5 which is abbreviated as DenseNet BC We only considered 3 3 kernels and did not compress the bottleneck or transition layers in these implementations Since the number of filters is a multiple of 12 we chose slices of shape 12 12 3 3 and code size of 72 to keep the ratio between the number of elements in the slice and n the same c We considered two cases when L 40 K 48 and L 40 K 36 where List he number of layers and K is the growth rate For the first case we could achieve 2 reduction with as light improvement inaccuracy For the second case the use of C SG had little effect on the accuracy of the network while reducing its parameters by over 1 8 4 2 2 Image Net 1000 IL SV RC 2012 Data set We have also trained the C SG augmented versions of ResNet 18 andResNet 50 on the Image Net 1000 IL SV RC 2012 data set We used the same hyper parameters as the ones mentioned in the original paper 11 namely we used batch sizes of 256 images and started from the learning rate of 0 1 and divided the learning rate by 10 every 30 epochs We continued the training for 100 epochs which is 20 epochs fewer than the original paper While ResNet 18 C SG 16 16 3 3 128 has a compression ratio of 1 54 it achieves a top 1 error of 28 5 which is 1 7 better than the implementation of,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Kernel-based support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised machine learning algorithms for classification and regression problems. We introduce a method to train SVMs on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer and study its performance in comparison to SVMs trained on conventional computers. The method is applied to both synthetic data and real data obtained from biology experiments. We find that the quantum annealer produces an ensemble of different solutions that often generalizes better to unseen data than the single global minimum of an SVM trained on a conventional computer, especially in cases where only limited training data is available. For cases with more training data than currently fits on the quantum annealer, we show that a combination of classifiers for subsets of the data almost always produces stronger joint classifiers than the conventional SVM for the same parameters.",by replacing the linear class i fier with a su the quantum anneal er can improve the classification per peri or nonlinear classification approach the kernel based form ance for the test data support vector machine SVM 9 10 We introduce its We conduct ourS VM experiments on aD Wave 2000 Q formulation for aD Wave quantum anneal er and present DW 2000 Q quantum anneal er 23 Quantum annealing training results for both synthetic data and real data QA is so far the only paradigm of quantum com put To distinguish between the SVM formulations we use ing for which processors of a reasonable size are avail the word classical to denote the original version of an able The other paradigm of quantum computing i e SVM as defined in 9 the gate based or universal quantum computer 25 is The field of supervised machine learning deals with the still limited to less than 100 quantum bits qu bits 26 problem of learning model parameters from a set of la It is worth mentioning that for gate based quantum com be led training data in order to make predictions about put ers a quantum algorithm for S VMs has already been test data S VMs in particular are known for their st a proposed 27 However only a few very simple tasks bil it y in comparison to decision trees or deep neural for which almost all classification was already done in networks 11 14 in the sense that small differences in the preprocessing step have been studied experimentally the training data do not generally produce huge differ 28 en ces in the resulting class if i ers Moreover kernel based QA requires the formulation of the computational S VMs profit from the kernel trick effectively man eu problem as a quadratic un constrained binary opt i miz a ve ring around the curse of dimensionality 9 15 In tion QU BO A QU BO problem is defined as the mini contrast to Deep Learning which often requires large miz ation of the energy function amounts of training data S VMs are typically used when cid 88 only small sets of training data are available But also E a Q a 1,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Sufficient supervised information is crucial for any machine learning models to boost performance. However, labeling data is expensive and sometimes difficult to obtain. Active learning is an approach to acquire annotations for data from a human oracle by selecting informative samples with a high probability to enhance performance. In recent emerging studies, a generative adversarial network (GAN) has been integrated with active learning to generate good candidates to be presented to the oracle. In this paper, we propose a novel model that is able to obtain labels for data in a cheaper manner without the need to query an oracle. In the model, a novel reward for each sample is devised to measure the degree of uncertainty, which is obtained from a classifier trained with existing labeled data. This reward is used to guide a conditional GAN to generate informative samples with a higher probability for a certain label. With extensive evaluations, we have confirmed the effectiveness of the model, showing that the generated samples are capable of improving the classification performance in popular image classification tasks.",in a In this subsection we discuss how the degree of uncertainty larger value of r than other certain samples Based on the is measured in the proposed model Among the samples gen m nature of Equation 6 u falls into the range of 0 1 The e rated by the AC GAN model only informative samples m values of r which fallin the range 1 1 have no sign if i might be able to contribute to improving classification per m e cant difference between the best and worst cases which may form ance In the area of active learning uncertainty sam result in an inappropriate design of the reward Inspired by p ling is the most widely used query strategy The intuition Lee et al 2018 we set a threshold cid 15 to truncate the value of behind uncertainty sampling is that if a sample is highly un reward for a bad case where the margin of two probabilities certain with a hyper plane of a class i fier obtaining its label is large Specifically given a threshold cid 15 the reward is will improve the degree of discrimination among classes In other words this sample is considered to be informative in r x cid 26 e um if u m cid 15 8 improving the classification performance In our model we m cid 98 i C otherwise useS VM as the class i fier In our paper we mainly use two metrics based on the label probabilities to measure the un where C is a constant number In our work we set its value certainty of a sample to 0 which means that if u m is larger than cid 15 we enforce the Smallest Margin Margin sampling is an uncertainty sam reward r m to be zero p ling method in the case of multi class Settles 2009 a With respect to label entropy we can calculate the which is defined as reward similar to r le x cid 98 i eu le where u le cid 80 p y cid 48 x log p y cid 48 x The reward for a generated x arg min P y cid 48 x P y cid 48 x 6 y cid 48 cid 98 i cid 98 i cid 98 M 1 cid 98 i 2 cid 98 i sample is calculated by combining the above two factors x cid 98 i which is formulated as where y cid 48 andy cid 48 are the first and second most probable class,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The aim of this study was to develop radiomic models using PET/CT radiomic features with different machine learning approaches for finding best predictive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) mutation status. Patients images including PET and CT [diagnostic (CTD) and low dose CT (CTA)] were pre-processed using wavelet (WAV), Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) and 64 bin discretization (BIN) (alone or in combinations) and several features from images were extracted. The prediction performance of model was checked using the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results showed a wide range of radiomic model AUC performances up to 0.75 in prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation status. Combination of K-Best and variance threshold feature selector with logistic regression (LREG) classifier in diagnostic CT scan led to the best performance in EGFR (CTD-BIN+B-KB+LREG, AUC: mean 0.75 sd 0.10) and KRAS (CTD-BIN-LOG-WAV+B-VT+LREG, AUC: mean 0.75 sd 0.07) respectively. Additionally, incorporating PET, kept AUC values at ~0.74. When considering conventional features only, highest predictive performance was achieved by PET SUVpeak (AUC: 0.69) for EGFR and by PET MTV (AUC: 0.55) for KRAS.

"Colorization is the method of converting an image in grayscale to a fully color image. There are multiple methods to do the same. Old school methods used machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques to suggest possible colors to use. With advances in the field of deep learning, colorization results have improved consistently with improvements in deep learning architectures. The latest development in the field of deep learning is the emergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs) which is used to generate information and not just predict or classify. As part of this report, 2 architectures of recent papers are reproduced along with a novel architecture being suggested for general colorization. Following this, we propose the use of colorization by generating makeup suggestions automatically on a face. To do this, a dataset consisting of 1000 images has been created. When an image of a person without makeup is sent to the model, the model first converts the image to grayscale and then passes it through the suggested GAN model. The output is a generated makeup suggestion. To develop this model, we need to tweak the general colorization model to deal only with faces of people.",have improved consistently with improvements in deep learning architectures The latest development in the field of deep learning is the emergence of generative adversarial networks GANs which is used to generate information and not just predict or classify As part of this report 2 architectures of recent papers are reproduced along with a novel architecture being suggested for general color iz ation Following this we propose the use of color iz ation by generating makeup suggestions automatically on a face To do this a data set consisting of 1000 images has been created When an image of a person without makeup is sent to the model the model first converts the image to grayscale and then passes it through the suggested GAN model The output is a generated makeup suggestion To develop this model we need to tweak the general color iz ation model to deal only with faces of people INTRODUCTION Traditionally color iz ation needed user intervention in the form of scribbling of colors over selected regions or using similar images to extract features for color iz ation again a user task as he has to determine a similar image first or performing preprocessing methods such as image segmentation to obtain segmented parts that can be used for the task of color iz ation Adding color to images can be done for many possible reasons Some of these include dormant memories that need to be rekindled converting age old black and white movies to color expressing artistic creativeness etc As mentioned above there are 2 main methods to color ize images User guided color iz ation Automatic color iz ation without user intervention User guided color iz ation often exhibit excellent color iz ation results However it becomes a tedious job There are many factors that this type of color iz ation algorithm depends on Some of these are need of an expert human color ize r to hint to the system each color region of the image has to be explicitly stated difficult to determine what shade of color has to be used etc Automatic color iz ation methods usually need little help from the user They can be trained automatically without need for human intervention Some of these recent methods have proved to produce some excellent results In the next section we discuss in brief about some of the methods in both user guided color iz ation and automatic color iz ation Further we implement some of these methods and view the results of the same Lastly we propose a novel new architecture to automatic color iz ation and then tweak the same slightly for automatic makeup suggestion BACKGROUND One of the earliest color iz ation methods was proposed by Levin et al 1 They used user scribbles as input to an image and propagated these scribbles through the image using optimization techniques A quadratic cost function was proposed and used This function was used to determine difference between a pixel and its neighbors Using these differences the algorithm could spread color Huang et al 2 improved this method by preventing color bleeding method of color extending beyond the necessary boundaries They used a reliable edge detection method that was quick in speed of execution whilst also being accurate enough to prevent color bleeding Ch rom in ance blending was a method suggested by Yat z iv et al 3 to improve the performance of color iz ation The ch rom in ance blending was done based on geodesic distances that was weighted This led to an increase in speed of the algorithm as well Lu an et al 4 proposed the use of texture similarity for better performance in color iz ation They introduced 2 steps color labelling and color mapping Pixels with roughly similar colors are grouped together in coherent regions and color mapping is used to fine tune the color iz ation process To aid with propagation of long range of image re color iz ation or editing tonal values An et al 5 proposed the use of an affinity based approach They used global optimization with all pair constraints The above mentioned methods produce some very good results However they are heavily dependent on user intervention in their input images Further they use trial and error methods to obtain their best results To overcome some of these problems color transfer techniques have been used These exploit color similarities between a provided reference image and the given input image One of the earliest color transfer techniques was proposed by Reinhard et al 6 They used simple statistical analysis to impose color characteristics of one image over the other Pi tie et al 7 provided a method for grading different colors in different images They found a one one mapping of colors that transfer from one reference image into the input image directly For this they developed a mapping algorithm that can transform any N dimensional probability density function into another The above mentioned methods compute statistics related to color information in both the input and a given reference image Using these statistics they establish mapping functions that map color distribution of the reference image to the given input image Using the color transfer mechanism as a backbone Welsh et al 8 proposed a technique to color ize images by matching lumi nance and texture information between the images An improvement was observed when a global optimization network which dealt with multi modal probability prediction was used The prediction was done for colors at each possible pixel This method was proposed by Irony et al 9 Gupta et al 10 proposed an approach of matching super pixels The super pixels were matched between the input image and a given reference image The matching was done using features extracted from each image and further space voting was done to obtain color iz ation results Again the above mentioned results perform well however they need a reference image that contains similar information to the given input image This is a time consuming task and certainly needs user intervention Cheng et al 11 proposed a completely automatic approach for color iz ation Various features were extracted from the image These features were used to color ize patches in the image by utilizing a neural network In order to improve the results joint bilateral filtering was utilized Recent methods have used for superior architectures aided by deep neural networks Ii z uk a et al 12 proposed an architecture that used low level mid level and global features for color iz ation They proposed the use of a classification network to aid the color iz ation process The classification network shared weights with an Autoencoder Further the output of the classification network was used as part of a fusion layer with the encoder architecture Zhang et al 13 use the underlying uncertainty of a color i zing problem by first using it as a classification problem and then utilizing class rebalancing at the time of training This helped to increase the diversity of colors in the result They implemented a feed forward CNN that was trained on over a million images Both semantic representations and low level feature representation was exploited by Larsson et al 14 They trained their model to predict per pixel color histograms They do this because most images have scene elements that can be represented by multi modal representations Gua dara mma et al 15 proposed an approach based on the idea that it is easy to color ize an image if we train a model with low resolution color images To do this they train a conditional Pixel CNN 16 to generate a low resolution color image for a given grayscale image They then train another CNN to convert this low resolution image into a high resolution image Makeup suggestion is a relatively new field in computer vision It is the task of taking an input image of a person and suggesting the possible makeup for that person based on certain features in the person There are very few datasets available for this task Chen et al 17 have provided one such data set but for a different context This was provided for detecting makeup on a person but it is a data set from which certain images can be extracted for the purpose of makeup generation D hall et al 18 suggest an adaptive makeup algorithm that is automatic in nature It applies makeup based on the ethnicity of skin color and gender of the person in the image However this algorithm gives the same results for people having same skin color and does not look specifically for facial features However one big advantage is that the process was completely automatic and did not need user intervention A hardware based system was developed by Iwa buch i et al 19 to make the makeup process easier to do Facilities like automatic zoom to a particular part of the face displaying face from different angles etc was provided with the aid of cameras in certain positions of an electronic dressing table However this is a very expensive process to set up Some of the recently developed methods for automatic makeup suggestion are as follows Li et al 20 proposed the separation of the input image into various intrinsic layers that can be modified based on certain reflectance models They believed this would aid in generating realistic results without the need for detailed geometric and reflectance measurements of the user Xu et al 21 provided an automatic method to suggest virtual makeup to a facial image based on example face images with makeup They detected face landmarks and adjusted the landmarks based on skin color Gaussian Mixture model based segmentation The skin layer was further separated into three layers and makeup is transferred to each layer A lashkar et al 22 developed a system that classifies makeup related facial traits that professional artists consider key to a makeup style They then use a rule based makeup recommendation system by developing a knowledge base system that models relationship between facial attributes and makeup attributes They take into account the level of makeup needed and the desired trend Another fully automatic approach was proposed by A lashkar et al 23 Here they used three stages for suggestion of makeup Firstly they classified facial traits into structured coding Then they passed these traits as input into a rule guided deep network model that utilizes pairwise before after makeup images and knowledge of a professional makeup artist Finally they provide visual results of their system We propose a color iz ation approach to makeup suggestion The color iz ation process automatically suggests color to facial traits that have makeup on based on the training done by the model The model s architecture the proposed data set and results are shown in the following sections First however we look at the results of some of the executed models from previous papers EVALUATED ALGORITHMS FOR COLOR IZ ATION The first model implemented was the model developed in 12 31 The architecture of the model taken from the paper is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Architecture of model in 12 The model was developed in Tensor flow from scratch The specifications of the model are exactly the same as those provided in the paper Figure 2 shows some of the outputs obtained from the model Figure 2 Output from model in 12 The next model implemented was not a paper However it is a model that formed the basis for many of the recent papers This model was developed with the belief the more information can be obtained from a pre trained CNN than just classification results This model is shown in Figure 3 and was used with residual connections Figure 3 Architecture of residual model The results obtained from this model are shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 Output of residual model We look at the model proposed in 12 and believe that the classification network can be replaced with pre trained models and a simple Autoencoder used can be replaced with GANs for more realistic looking results The proposed architecture includes the same The proposed method is discussed in the next section PROPOSED METHOD MODEL ARCHITECTURE As mentioned in the previous section a few tweaks have been made into the architecture of the model proposed in 12 First we believe that the classification network used is very simple and that using a better network pre trained on a big data set like image net 24 would give better results Pre trained models such as VGG 25 Inception ResNet 26 ResNet 27 DenseNet 28 etc are available These models have the ability to classify the contents of the image more accurately than the simple network used in the model Further utilizing GANs 29 over Autoencoders for training should yield better results because of the ability of the GAN to generate better images In particular we consider the use of DC GANs proposed by Radford et al 30 as the model for color iz ation This is because the training of GANs can be unstable and difficult to deal with This proposed model is a general color iz ation model The classification network is removed when we want to develop an automatic makeup suggestion system This is because the makeup system deals with only face images and we do not need a model pre trained on image net for the same We use the LAB color space instead of the RGB color space because of the minimization of per pixel correlation in the LAB color space The L channel called the lightness channel is essentially a grayscale version of the color image and the AB channels are ch rom in ance channels that add color to the image Formally given I which is a grayscale image we wish to generate the ch rom in ance value L,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) play an increasingly important role in machine learning. However, there is one fundamental issue hindering their practical applications: the absence of capability for encoding real-world samples. The conventional way of addressing this issue is to learn an encoder for GAN via Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). In this paper, we show that the entanglement of the latent space for the VAE/GAN framework poses the main challenge for encoder learning. To address the entanglement issue and enable inference in GAN we propose a novel algorithm named Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA). The framework of LIA is that an invertible network and its inverse mapping are symmetrically embedded in the latent space of VAE. The decoder of LIA is first trained as a standard GAN with the invertible network and then the partial encoder is learned from a disentangled autoencoder by detaching the invertible network from LIA, thus avoiding the entanglement problem caused by the random latent space. Experiments conducted on the FFHQ face dataset and three LSUN datasets validate the effectiveness of LIA/GAN.",on FF HQ and L SUN datasets show the proposed method Method Formulation achieves superior

"We introduce a new molecular dataset, named Alchemy, for developing machine learning models useful in chemistry and material science. As of June 20th 2019, the dataset comprises of 12 quantum mechanical properties of 119,487 organic molecules with up to 14 heavy atoms, sampled from the GDB MedChem database. The Alchemy dataset expands the volume and diversity of existing molecular datasets. Our extensive benchmarks of the state-of-the-art graph neural network models on Alchemy clearly manifest the usefulness of new data in validating and developing machine learning models for chemistry and material science. We further launch a contest to attract attentions from researchers in the related fields. More details can be found on the contest website \footnote{https://alchemy.tencent.com}.

"Predicting molecular properties (e.g., atomization energy) is an essential issue in quantum chemistry, which could speed up much research progress, such as drug designing and substance discovery. Traditional studies based on density functional theory (DFT) in physics are proved to be time-consuming for predicting large number of molecules. Recently, the machine learning methods, which consider much rule-based information, have also shown potentials for this issue. However, the complex inherent quantum interactions of molecules are still largely underexplored by existing solutions. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and transferable Multilevel Graph Convolutional neural Network (MGCN) for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we represent each molecule as a graph to preserve its internal structure. Moreover, the well-designed hierarchical graph neural network directly extracts features from the conformation and spatial information followed by the multilevel interactions. As a consequence, the multilevel overall representations can be utilized to make the prediction. Extensive experiments on both datasets of equilibrium and off-equilibrium molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, the detailed results also prove that MGCN is generalizable and transferable for the prediction.",indicated that it took nearly an hour to predict the properties of merely one molecule with 20 atoms Gil mere tal 2017 Obviously it is unacceptable to make prediction on large number of molecules in chemical compound space There fore it is necessary to find more effective solutions Recently inspired by the remarkable success of machine learning in many tasks including computer vision natural language processing natural and social science Kar path yet al 2014 Hee tal 2016 Huan get al 2017 Zhu et al 2018 Liu et al 2018 researchers have shown the potentials of these data driven techniques for molecular property pre dic tion Faber et al 2017 Schu tte tal 2017 a Generally these studies mainly rely on rule based feature engineering e g bag of atom bonds or treat molecules as grid like structures e g 2 D images or text However few of them directly take the inherent quantum interactions of molecules into consid e ration causing severe information loss which makes the molecular property prediction problem pretty much open Unfortunately there are many technical and domain chal leng es along this line First there are highly complex quan tum interactions such as distracted attraction exchange re pul sion and electrostatic interaction in molecules especially in the large molecules Koll man 1985 It is hard to model them with analytical methods Second compared with tra d it ional tasks including computer vision the amount of la be led molecule data is significantly limited which requires a general iz able approach for the prediction Last but not least in practice we are often provided with labeled data of small,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, cardiovascular disease, and end-stage renal disease, and its prevalence is expected to rise dramatically. Effective hypertension management is thus critical. A particular priority is decreasing the incidence of uncontrolled hypertension. Early identification of patients at risk for uncontrolled hypertension would allow targeted use of personalized, proactive treatments. We develop machine learning models (logistic regression and recurrent neural networks) to stratify patients with respect to the risk of exhibiting uncontrolled hypertension within the coming three-month period. We trained and tested models using EHR data from 14,407 and 3,009 patients, respectively. The best model achieved an AUROC of 0.719, outperforming the simple, competitive baseline of relying prediction based on the last BP measure alone (0.634). Perhaps surprisingly, recurrent neural networks did not outperform a simple logistic regression for this task, suggesting that linear models should be included as strong baselines for predictive tasks using EHR",We compared developed models against the natural baseline of using the patient sBP measure from their mostrecent last visit as the prediction for current visit This is a reasonably competitive approach because hypertension status exhibits strong auto correlation and our prediction window is relatively narrow 90 days Were port results on the test set in Table 3 also summarized in Figure 4 To provide further insights into model predictions we inspect which variables are most responsible for the predictions of a given model In case of LR a linear model we simply rank features by absolute weight We report the top highest weighted 20 variables in Table 4 a Inferring the importance of variables in LS TMs is not as straightforward and multiple options for doing so exist Here we adopt a recently proposed method for analyzing deep neural networks integrated gradients IG 16 This method provides a signed importance score for each variable that reflects its sum contribution to the output More concretely for each data point this method calculates the integral of the gradient of output i e y with respect to each input variable at each time step as we move said variable from the baseline of its current or observed value If the output changes significantly as we vary only one dimension i e the absolute value of integral is large the corresponding variable is deemed important For additional technical details we refer the reader to the original paper 16 Were port the top features for the LSTM inferred via IG in Table 4 b Were port weights for the top 50 features for both models in the Appendix Generally speaking important features align with intuition Blood pressure status controlled vs uncontrolled encoded as 0 and 1 respectively and systolic BP measurements from prior visits are strongly predictive features in both models as would be expected Conclusion All individuals involved in the various aspects of patient care stand to benefit from tools that aid informed clinical decision making From a provider s perspective identifying which hypertensive patients are likely to become or remain uncontrolled can guide targeted timely interventions and proactive tailored treatments There by preventing or decreasing the incidence of adverse complications due to uncontrolled hypertension and improving clinical outcomes and reducing healthcare costs

work on the problem 8 We also find perhaps somewhat surprisingly that a simple Logistic Regression model performs about the same as a complex RNN Simple linear models should always be considered as a strong baseline for predictive tasks over E HR Study limitations This study has several important limitations both technical and conceptual First due to the tr an s it ion of the E HR system to EPIC there was a gap between medical notes dates and the encounter dates Therefore we were not able to use notes in the current work incorporating these may improve the model Second this retro spec ti ve analysis means we had to winnow the set of patients included in the analysis for practical reasons Figure 1 Third for simplicity we replaced missing values with simple means a naive form of imputation More soph is tica ted imputation methods including Bayesian models 17 and neural network imputation approaches 18 may yield improved performance 17 We excluded the variables presented in Appendix E due to a high proportion of missing values 99 which could adversely affect the performance of the model 19 Few of these excluded variables are likely to be clinically relevant according to the domain experts involved in this project Note that all patients had varying numbers of missing values but we did not exclude any of them based on missing values rather these were simply imputed as outlined above A final potential limitation of this work concerns our creation of target labels Todos owe required that patients in our cohort had two visits within 90 days so that the latter of these could serve as the target This excluded 2 580 patients who did not meet this condition This winnowing process may have induced a bias in the sample used for this study i e we cannot be certain that the resultant patient set is representative of the underlying population We have here demonstrated that one can achieve reasonably good predictive performance for this task But if such models are to be

"Many Machine Learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks, have long been criticized for being ""black-boxes""-a kind of models unable to provide how it arrive at a decision without further efforts to interpret. This problem has raised concerns on model applications' trust, safety, nondiscrimination, and other ethical issues. In this paper, we discuss the machine learning interpretability of a real-world application, eXtreme Multi-label Learning (XML), which involves learning models from annotated data with many pre-defined labels. We propose a two-step XML approach that combines deep non-negative autoencoder with other multi-label classifiers to tackle different data applications with a large number of labels. Our experimental result shows that the proposed approach is able to cope with many-label problems as well as to provide interpretable label hierarchies and dependencies that helps us understand how the model recognizes the existences of objects in an image.",were implemented in R 3 5 1 31 with Ker as 32 and were performed on a computing server with two Intel Xeon CPUs and two NVIDIA Geforce GT X 1080 Ti GPUs Figure 4 shows an example of ingredient label prediction for the dish Fried Chicken Here we provide top 25 most probable ingredients and the text of matched ingredients are in bold Actual Ingredient Predicted Ingredient chicken oil lemon buttermilk pepper coriander plain flour onion milk corn flour butter chilli oregano salt powder chilli powder garlic stock sage sugar cream basil plain flour c h i cken Figure 6 Image explanation with label hierarchy for marjoram egg cumin pepper ice wine Hallo umi with quick sweet chilli sauce salt olive oil rice Fried Chicken paprika ginger cinnamon onion salt nut cola if we see something resembling to the highlighted part of garlic oil the image we could say it is most likely chickens or coleslaw silver sides with ingredient sets made with garlic garlic Figure 4 Fried Chicken with actual and predicted bread onion guacamole and so on Another interesting ingredients finding is that take Figure 5 and Figure 6 as the example even though the ingredients exhibit large visual As there are often noises in most of real word images differences because of diverse ways of cooking the e g plate in Figure 4 we expect the model would not explanations with labels can still show us how to visually perform perfectly We may have created some unknown identify ingredients in a dish which is usually known by object detectors as discussed previously Without clear trained professional cooks targets correctly labeled and pre processed images the Besides we also found that some labels never occur in model is unable to perceive what to predict On the predictions simply because in the recipe ingredient label other hand without model explanations we are unable to matrix of the training data many ingredients labels occur know why the model made a prediction Therefore we in only a few recipes rows while some ingredients occur are in need of interpret able models or model explain ers in in most of the recipes In the label predictions of BBC such cases To further justify the prediction we used the data some dominant ingredients e g salt eggs and oils aforementioned LIME to generate the image explanations would always be in the most of the predictions whereas Figure 5 shows an example of the image explanation some essential ingredients e g t bone steak for recipe with its label hierarchy for the dish in Figure 4 The Char grilled T Bone Steak would hardly be found in super pixels to explain are highlighted in green The any predicted label sets tail label problems 23 Our explain er tells us the highlighted part of the image is most approach currently focuses only on building deep model likely the label 9 of the coefficient matrix H which architecture to discover label hierarchy with interpret able,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"This paper investigates the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to enable intelligent systems to learn multi-party turn-taking models from dialogue logs. The specific ML task consists of determining who speaks next, after each utterance of a dialogue, given who has spoken and what was said in the previous utterances. With this goal, this paper presents comparisons of the accuracy of different ML techniques such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, with and without utterance data. We present three corpora: the first with dialogues from an American TV situated comedy (chit-chat), the second with logs from a financial advice multi-bot system and the third with a corpus created from the Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset (both are topic-oriented). The results show: (i) the size of the corpus has a very positive impact on the accuracy for the content-based deep learning approaches and those models perform best in the larger datasets; and (ii) if the dialogue dataset is small and topic-oriented (but with few topics), it is sufficient to use an agent-only MLE or SVM models, although slightly higher accuracies can be achieved with the use of the content of the utterances with a CNN model.",In this section we present the training approach and the results with the agent based base lines models and the learning models considering both content and agent information for both the sitcom data set and the finch data set 5 1 Training Approach Our model does not constraint with regard to waiting for a specific moment to start pre dic ting it follows a more classical batch learning process For both corpora we considered a 70 30 train test split where 70 of subsequent dialogues are used for training and the remaining 30 for testing In order to set meta parameters for the models cross validation has been applied on the training set Regarding the number of clusters for the M LE based architecture after some trials and observing how the clusters were created in a PCA 20 2 D plot we para met rize d the model with six 6 clusters for the sitcom data five 5 for finch data and seven 7 for multi bot woz Although the number of classes are identical to the number of agents we did not find a correlation between the clusters and the agents or the conditional interaction between the agents The vocabulary is built with training and testing data therefore all words had WE and there were no words which where O OV For both the embedding and the hidden layers in the AC CNN models Rectified Linear Units activation functions Re lu are applied For the training we make use of the Adam opt i mizer with 3 epochs for training and learning rate set to 0 001 Batch size is set to 50 for the sitcom data set and 5 for finch and multi woz data And for the AC LSTM architecture one LSTM layer was considered with output size set to 90 for the TV sitcom data set and to 50 for the finch and multi woz datasets To evaluate the models and compare the results we have computed the accuracy metric 5 2 Evaluation of the Proposed Methods The Repeat Last baseline achieves an accuracy of 61 34 on the sitcom data set 57 64 on finch and 86 49 on multi bot woz From the results shown in Tables 6 and 7 we can see in all datasets that higher accuracy values can be achieved when two turns are considered i e with a look back window equals to two than when only the last turn is considered Although we have also trained M LE based models with look back windows ranging from three to five we do not present the results here because they did not improve over the accuracy of the models with look back window equals to two sitcom finch multi bot woz Baseline 61 34 57 64 86 49 W W W W W W,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Kernel-based machine learning approaches are gaining increasing interest for exploring and modeling large dataset in recent years. Gaussian process (GP) is one example of such kernel-based approaches, which can provide very good performance for nonlinear modeling problems. In this work, we first propose a grey-box modeling approach to analyze the forces in cross country skiing races. To be more precise, a disciplined set of kinetic motion model formulae is combined with data-driven Gaussian process regression model, which accounts for everything unknown in the system. Then, a modeling approach is proposed to analyze the kinetic flow of both individual and clusters of skiers. The proposed approaches can be generally applied to use cases where positioned trajectories and kinetic measurements are available. The proposed approaches are evaluated using data collected from the Falun Nordic World Ski Championships 2015, in particular the Men's cross country $4\times10$ km relay. Forces during the cross country skiing races are analyzed and compared. Velocity models for skiers at different competition stages are also evaluated. Finally, the comparisons between the grey-box and black-box approach are carried out, where the grey-box approach can reduce the predictive uncertainty by $30\%$ to $40\%$.",3 3 Kernel Selection Kernel function is a key component of GP as it encodes the assumptions about the function which we wish to learn The kernel function reflects the similarity between data points Rasmussen and Williams 2006 In this subsection the selection of different kernels will be discussed One classic kernel function is the Squared Exponential SE kernel defined by d d 2 k d d 2 exp s l 2 cid 20 d cid 21 where 2 is the variance of the function and l is the length scale which de s d term in es how rapidly the function varies with d The SE kernel is considered as the most widely used kernel However it implies a stationary model which forbids structured extrapolation K lens ke et al 2016 In some specific cases this kernel function may show poor performance in prediction for instance in sport races where there is periodic pattern overlaps Considering this it is more appropriate to adopt a periodic kernel which can reflect the similarities between different laps However strict periodicity is too rigid because there may be some deviations in each lap e g due to the strength loss of the in di vi dual strategies used in competition etc Hence we adopt a local periodic LP kernel which is a product of an SE kernel and a periodic kernel s in 2 d d d d 2 k d d 2 exp exp 18 s cid 16 l p 2 cid 17 l d 2 where l is the length scale of the periodic kernel and is the period length p This kernel considers two inputs are similar if they are similar under both the SE and the periodic kernels If l this allows encoding a decay in the d co variance over several oscillations K lens ke et al 2016 The key benefits of this kernel is that it outperforms SE kernel in prediction when the distance from the data is increasing as illustrated in K lens ke et al 2016 Fig 4 Gaussian Processes for Analyzing Positioned Trajectories in Sports 11 Lastly we note that the LP kernel in 18 is not necessary optimal in our application but as will be shown in our simulations it gives very good modeling and prediction results Interested readers can refer Duve n aud et al 2013 Wilson and Adams 2013 Yin et al 2018 for strategies for selecting an optimal kernel from the training data 3 4 Hyper parameters Determination Given the S GP model and the kernel in 3 1 and 3 3 respectively the hyper pa ra meters to be calibrated are 2 2 l l T n s p d The likelihood function of the observed ground speed with respect to the hyper parameters can be written as follows p v d N m d C d d 19 Here the maximum likelihood estimate M LE is derived Details are given in Appendix A In the O GP we assumed that the parameters are known before the recursive process starts This can be the case when some historical expert knowledge is available or a small set of the training data can be used to train the parameters like we did for the S GP Huber demonstrated in Huber 2014 that these parameters can be learned on line as well,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The classification of amino acids and their sequence analysis plays a vital role in life sciences and is a challenging task. This article uses and compares state-of-the-art deep learning models like convolution neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU) to solve macromolecule classification problems using amino acids. These models have efficient frameworks for solving a broad spectrum of complex learning problems compared to traditional machine learning techniques. We use word embedding to represent the amino acid sequences as vectors. The CNN extracts features from amino acid sequences, which are treated as vectors, then fed to the models mentioned above to train a robust classifier.

"The exclusive or (xor) function is one of the simplest examples that illustrate why nonlinear feedforward networks are superior to linear regression for machine learning applications. We review the xor representation and approximation problems and discuss their solutions in terms of probabilistic logic and associative copula functions. After briefly reviewing the specification of feedforward networks, we compare the dynamics of learned error surfaces with different activation functions such as RELU and tanh through a set of colorful three-dimensional charts. The copula representations extend xor from Boolean to real values, thereby providing a convenient way to demonstrate the concept of cross-validation on in-sample and out-sample data sets. Our approach is pedagogical and is meant to be a machine learning prolegomenon.",The 2 2 1 xor approximation problem using 4 Boolean inputs as the training set should be simple enough to completely analyze Part of our motivation was to try to understand why the simple 2 2 1 in p RE LU RE LU networks trained to solve the xor representation problem were able to generalize its results to copula based xor representations on an out sample data set of real values between zero and one Comparing the outputs of a machine learning experiment with values not seen in the training set is called cross validation In the following we examine the copula representations in the context of selecting in sample and out sample data for cross validation 7 1 From Boolean Values to Analog Values In Section 2 we have seen that in the context of probabilistic logic copulas provide a consistent way to extend a set of Boolean values to a set of analog values for both inputs and outputs If a logical statement can be represented in terms of and or and not then the probability of the statement can be represented in terms of copulas,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"We study the application of dynamic pricing to insurance. We view this as an online revenue management problem where the insurance company looks to set prices to optimize the long-run revenue from selling a new insurance product. We develop two pricing models: an adaptive Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and an adaptive Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Both balance between exploration, where we choose prices in order to learn the distribution of demands & claims for the insurance product, and exploitation, where we myopically choose the best price from the information gathered so far. The performance of the pricing policies is measured in terms of regret: the expected revenue loss caused by not using the optimal price. As is commonplace in insurance, we model demand and claims by GLMs. In our adaptive GLM design, we use the maximum quasi-likelihood estimation (MQLE) to estimate the unknown parameters. We show that, if prices are chosen with suitably decreasing variability, the MQLE parameters eventually exist and converge to the correct values, which in turn implies that the sequence of chosen prices will also converge to the optimal price. In the adaptive GP regression model, we sample demand and claims from Gaussian Processes and then choose selling prices by the upper confidence bound rule. We also analyze these GLM and GP pricing algorithms with delayed claims. Although similar results exist in other domains, this is among the first works to consider dynamic pricing problems in the field of insurance. We also believe this is the first work to consider Gaussian Process regression in the context of insurance pricing. These initial findings suggest that online machine learning algorithms could be a fruitful area of future investigation and application in insurance.",to a duo poly and an oligopoly settings Following this Fib ich et al 34 then calculate explicitly the optimal pricing strategy in various non smooth optimization problems All of these works assume the demand function of consumers is deterministic and known Surveys by Aviv and Vulcano 35 and den Boer 36 provide an excellent overview of this area Adaptive Generalized Linear Models N elder and Wedderburn 3 first introduce Generalized Linear Mod els GL M which is an extension to classical Linear Regression As discussed above it has become a well established and standardised statistical technique to price the insurance products 25 37 In the GL M framework maximum likelihood estimation is a commonly used technique to find the parameters of a given Generalized Linear Models Wedderburn 38 proposes a method named quasi likelihood es tima tion an extension of likelihood estimations but only the first two moments of the observations are needed Mc Cull a gh and N edler 4 then apply G LMs with quasi likelihood estimation to insurance rate making They fit a GL M to different types of data including average claim costs for a motor insurance portfolio and claims frequency for marine insurance To price products often a certainty equivalence rule is used Here the optimal price is chosen for the estimated parameters Thus when optimizing we treat estimates as if they were the true unknown parameters of the model Anderson and Taylor 39 apply a certainty equivalence rule to solve a multi period control problem However strong consistency may not hold when applying a certainty equivalence rule to maximum quasi likelihood estimates 7 9 To deal with this problem conditions are proposed,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Recognizing activities of daily living (ADLs) plays an essential role in analyzing human health and behavior. The widespread availability of sensors implanted in homes, smartphones, and smart watches have engendered collection of big datasets that reflect human behavior.

In this study, we investigate a method for automatically extracting universal and meaningful features that are applicable across similar time series-based learning tasks such as activity recognition and fall detection. We propose creating a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to perform this feature learning. Beside avoiding feature engineering, the meaningful features learned by the seq2seq model can also be utilized for semi-supervised learning.

"To detect GAN generated images, conventional supervised machine learning algorithms require collection of a number of real and fake images from the targeted GAN model. However, the specific model used by the attacker is often unavailable. To address this, we propose a GAN simulator, AutoGAN, which can simulate the artifacts produced by the common pipeline shared by several popular GAN models. Additionally, we identify a unique artifact caused by the up-sampling component included in the common GAN pipeline. We show theoretically such artifacts are manifested as replications of spectra in the frequency domain and thus propose a classifier model based on the spectrum input, rather than the pixel input. By using the simulated images to train a spectrum based classifier, even without seeing the fake images produced by the targeted GAN model during training, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances on detecting fake images generated by popular GAN models such as CycleGAN.",in replications of spectra in the frequency domain To included in the common GAN pipeline We show theoretically directly discriminate the GAN induced up sampling artifacts such artifacts are manifested as replications of spectra in the we propose to train a class i fier using the frequency spectrum frequency domain and thus propose a class i fier model based on the spectrum input rather than the pixel input By using as input instead of the raw RGB pixel We will show through the simulated images to train a spectrum based class i fier even experiments that the spectrum based class i fier trained even without seeing the fake images produced by the targeted GAN with images from only one semantic category e g real and model during training our approach achieves state of the art fake horse images generalizes well to other unseen categories performances on detecting fake images generated by popular We further propose to address the situation where there is no GAN models such as CycleGAN access to pre trained GAN models by using a GAN simulator,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Graphs are an essential part of many machine learning problems such as analysis of parse trees, social networks, knowledge graphs, transportation systems, and molecular structures. Applying machine learning in these areas typically involves learning the graph structure and the relationship between the nodes of the graph. However, learning the graph structure is often complex, particularly when the graph is cyclic, and the transitions from one node to another are conditioned such as graphs used to represent a finite state machine. To solve this problem, we propose to extend the memory based Neural Turing Machine (NTM) with two novel additions. We allow for transitions between nodes to be influenced by information received from external environments, and we let the NTM learn the context of those transitions. We refer to this extension as the Conditional Neural Turing Machine (CNTM). We show that the CNTM can infer conditional transition graphs by empirically verifiying the model on two data sets: a large set of randomly generated graphs, and a graph modeling the information retrieval process during certain crisis situations. The results show that the CNTM is able to reproduce the paths inside the graph with accuracy ranging from 82,12% for 10 nodes graphs to 65,25% for 100 nodes graphs.",shown by the RNN applied to represent a finite state machine To solve this problem we propose learning family trees sparse trees for natural language process to extend the memory based Neural Turing Machine NT M with ing and transportation systems its application on network and two novel additions We allow for transitions between nodes to be influenced by information received from external environments graph data is still limited to simple cases In this paper we are and we let the NT M learn the context of those transitions We interested in graphs where transition from a node to another refer to this extension as the Conditional Neural Turing Machine is conditioned by an external input A real world analogy to CNT M better understand conditional graphs is a model of the thought We show that the CNT M can infer conditional transition process of a person Lets assume that the person is hungry In graphs by empirically ver if i ying the model on two data sets a large set of randomly generated graphs and a graph modeling our simple example many states can follow but we narrow it the information retrieval process during certain crisis situations down two possibilities The first possibility is that he sits down The results show that the CNT M is able to reproduce the paths for lunch The other possibility is that he instead only has a inside the graph with accuracy ranging from 82 12 for 10 nodes small snack The possible states are the neither eating lunch graphs to 65 25 for 100 nodes graphs or eating a snack Whether he goes to any of those states is Index Terms Memory based neural network Graph model conditioned It depends on many aspects much of which he ing Link prediction Crisis management does not have control over such as the time of day and his hunger level In this case the person undergoes a conditional,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Adversarial examples are of wide concern due to their impact on the reliability of contemporary machine learning systems. Effective adversarial examples are mostly found via white-box attacks. However, in some cases they can be transferred across models, thus enabling them to attack black-box models. In this work we evaluate the transferability of three adversarial attacks - the Fast Gradient Sign Method, the Basic Iterative Method, and the Carlini & Wagner method, across two classes of models - the VGG class(using VGG16, VGG19 and an ensemble of VGG16 and VGG19), and the Inception class(Inception V3, Xception, Inception Resnet V2, and an ensemble of the three).

"Learning features from data has shown to be more successful than using hand-crafted features for many machine learning tasks. In music information retrieval (MIR), features learned from windowed spectrograms are highly variant to transformations like transposition or time-shift. Such variances are undesirable when they are irrelevant for the respective MIR task. We propose an architecture called Complex Autoencoder (CAE) which learns features invariant to orthogonal transformations. Mapping signals onto complex basis functions learned by the CAE results in a transformation-invariant ""magnitude space"" and a transformation-variant ""phase space"". The phase space is useful to infer transformations between data pairs. When exploiting the invariance-property of the magnitude space, we achieve state-of-the-art results in audio-to-score alignment and repeated section discovery for audio.

"We introduce two challenging datasets that reliably cause machine learning model performance to substantially degrade. The datasets are collected with a simple adversarial filtration technique to create datasets with limited spurious cues. Our datasets' real-world, unmodified examples transfer to various unseen models reliably, demonstrating that computer vision models have shared weaknesses. The first dataset is called ImageNet-A and is like the ImageNet test set, but it is far more challenging for existing models. We also curate an adversarial out-of-distribution detection dataset called ImageNet-O, which is the first out-of-distribution detection dataset created for ImageNet models. On ImageNet-A a DenseNet-121 obtains around 2% accuracy, an accuracy drop of approximately 90%, and its out-of-distribution detection performance on ImageNet-O is near random chance levels.

"An open secret in contemporary machine learning is that many models work beautifully on standard benchmarks but fail to generalize outside the lab. This has been attributed to biased training data, which provide poor coverage over real world events. Generative models are no exception, but recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) suggest otherwise - these models can now synthesize strikingly realistic and diverse images. Is generative modeling of photos a solved problem? We show that although current GANs can fit standard datasets very well, they still fall short of being comprehensive models of the visual manifold. In particular, we study their ability to fit simple transformations such as camera movements and color changes. We find that the models reflect the biases of the datasets on which they are trained (e.g., centered objects), but that they also exhibit some capacity for generalization: by ""steering"" in latent space, we can shift the distribution while still creating realistic images. We hypothesize that the degree of distributional shift is related to the breadth of the training data distribution. Thus, we conduct experiments to quantify the limits of GAN transformations and introduce techniques to mitigate the problem. Code is released on our project page: https://ali-design.github.io/gan_steerability/",add nuance to this story It is possible to achieve distribution al shift but the ability to create realistic images from a modified distributions relies on sufficient diversity in the data set along the dimension that we vary Our main findings are A simple walkin the latent space of GANs achieves camera motion and color transform a t ions in the output image space These walks are learned in self supervised manner without labeled attributes or distinct source and target images The linear walk is as effective as more complex non linear walks suggesting that the mod els learn to roughly linear ize these operations without being explicitly trained to do so The extent of each transformation is limited and we quantify a relationship between data set variability and how much we can shift the model distribution The transformations area general purpose framework that work with different model arch i tec ture s e g BigGAN StyleGAN and DCGAN and illustrate different disentanglement properties in the irrespective latent spaces Data augmentation improves steer ability as does jointly training the walk trajectory and the generator weights which allows us to achieve larger transformation effects,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently achieved great success in many tasks, which encourages DNNs to be widely used as a machine learning service in model sharing scenarios. However, attackers can easily generate adversarial examples with a small perturbation to fool the DNN models to predict wrong labels. To improve the robustness of shared DNN models against adversarial attacks, we propose a novel method called Latent Adversarial Defence (LAD). The proposed LAD method improves the robustness of a DNN model through adversarial training on generated adversarial examples. Different from popular attack methods which are carried in the input space and only generate adversarial examples of repeating patterns, LAD generates myriad of adversarial examples through adding perturbations to latent features along the normal of the decision boundary which is constructed by an SVM with an attention mechanism. Once adversarial examples are generated, we adversarially train the model through augmenting the training data with generated adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in defending against different types of adversarial attacks.",tuning As such it accelerates the development of D NN However very often test examples are very likely to be models to be hosted in a cloud and run as a service that can mixed with unknown adversarial examples 9 10 which be shared by a third party This leads to many online machine could be unnoticeable to end users Adversarial examples learning as service platforms MLa aS that provide Web based can be generated by attackers through adding small crafted API services for various tasks based on D NN models For perturbations to legitimate examples These examples are often example image and video analysis from the AW S pre trained indistinguishable to human eyes so they can easily fool D NN A I Services 7 powerful image analysis from Google Cloud models to predict wrong labels What makes it even worse is Vision 8 In such model sharing scenarios the increasing use of D NN that these adversarial examples can be generated by various models however has raised serious security and reliability types of unknown attack methods leading a dramatic drop concerns This can be illustrated in Fig 1 The service in classification accuracy This is attributed to the fact that providers train D NN models using the data set they collect the shared D NN models are not robustly trained to defend which are expected to achieve high classification accuracy on various unknown adversarial attacks before they are released test examples having similar distributions with the training as a service Thus in this paper we are mainly concerned about how to enhance the adversarial robustness of shared X Zhou is with the Centre for Artificial Intelligence FE IT University of D NN models from service provider perspectives Technology Sydney Ultimo NSW 2007 Australia and Data 61 CSIRO NSW To enhance the robustness of D NN models against various 2122 Australia e mail Xiao wei Zhou student ut s edu au,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs) have become widely popular in recent times. Most of the commercial IPAs today support a wide range of skills including Alarms, Reminders, Weather Updates, Music, News, Factual Questioning-Answering, etc. The list grows every day, making it difficult to remember the command structures needed to execute various tasks. An IPA must have the ability to communicate information about supported skills and direct users towards the right commands needed to execute them. Users interact with personal assistants in natural language. A query is defined to be a Help Query if it seeks information about a personal assistant's capabilities, or asks for instructions to execute a task. In this paper, we propose an interactive system which identifies help queries and retrieves appropriate responses. Our system comprises of a C-BiLSTM based classifier, which is a fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) architectures, to detect help queries and a semantic Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) module to map the query to an appropriate predefined response.

"Aesthetics are critically important to market acceptance. In the automotive industry, an improved aesthetic design can boost sales by 30% or more. Firms invest heavily in designing and testing aesthetics. A single automotive ""theme clinic"" can cost over $100,000, and hundreds are conducted annually. We propose a model to augment the commonly-used aesthetic design process by predicting aesthetic scores and automatically generating innovative and appealing product designs. The model combines a probabilistic variational autoencoder (VAE) with adversarial components from generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a supervised learning component. We train and evaluate the model with data from an automotive partner-images of 203 SUVs evaluated by targeted consumers and 180,000 high-quality unrated images. Our model predicts well the appeal of new aesthetic designs-43.5% improvement relative to a uniform baseline and substantial improvement over conventional machine learning models and pretrained deep neural networks. New automotive designs are generated in a controllable manner for use by design teams. We empirically verify that automatically generated designs are (1) appealing to consumers and (2) resemble designs which were introduced to the market five years after our data were collected. We provide an additional proof-of-concept application using opensource images of dining room chairs.",in limited training data In our automotive application we are fortunate to have 7 308 aesthetic ratings by consumers for 203 vehicles but those ratings alone would be insufficient to estimate a predictive and or generative model with high dimensional image data We address these practical challenges by training an encoding model to embed images in a lower dimensional vector space Embedding s reduce the dimensionality of the images for the predictive and generative models by leveraging both the relatively thin and expensive labeled training data images with aesthetic ratings with a much larger sample of unlabeled training data 180 000 images without consumer evaluations 2 Success depends upon whether the embedding s compress the important information from the full images while allowing us to predict human aesthetic judgments and generate perceptual ly realistic new designs Embedding s using a neural network have seen recent adoption in marketing science For example Timo shen ko and Hauser 2019 embed textual data to identify consumer needs Liu Lee and Srinivasa n 2019 embed product reviews to predict sales conversion Liu D zy a bur a and Miz ik 2020 embed social media images to predict identity Dew Ansari and To u bia 2022 embed firms logos to describe brand,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Regional rainfall-runoff modeling is an old but still mostly out-standing problem in Hydrological Sciences. The problem currently is that traditional hydrological models degrade significantly in performance when calibrated for multiple basins together instead of for a single basin alone. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and demonstrate that under a 'big data' paradigm, this is not necessarily the case. By training a single LSTM model on 531 basins from the CAMELS data set using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM (EA-LSTM), that allows for learning, and embedding as a feature layer in a deep learning model, catchment similarities. We show that this learned catchment similarity corresponds well with what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.",we can already assume that this general modeling approach is promising and has the potential for region aliz ation The objectives of this study are i to demonstrate that we can use large sample hydrology data Gupta et al 2014 Peters Lid a rde tal 2017 to develop a regional rainfall runoff model that capitalizes on observable ancillary data in the form of catchment attributes to produce accurate stream flow estimates over a large number of basins ii to benchmark the performance of our neural network model against several existing hydrology models and iii to show how the model uses information about catchment characteristics to differentiate between different rainfall runoff behaviors To this end we built anLSTM based model that learns catchment similarities directly from meteorological forcing data and ancillary data of multiple basins and evaluate its performance in a gauged setting meaning that we never ask our model to predict in a basin where it did not see training data Concretely we propose an adaption of the LSTM where catchment attributes explicitly control which parts of the LSTM state space are used for a given basin Because the model is trained using both catchment attributes and meteorological time series data to predict stream flow it can learn how to combine different parts of the network to simulate different types of rainfall runoff behaviors In principle the approach explicitly allows for sharing parts of the networks for similarly behaving basins while using different independent parts for basins with completely different rainfall runoff behavior Furthermore our adaption provides a mapping from catchment attribute space into a learned high dimensional space i e a so called embedding in which catchment s with similar rainfall runoff behavior can be placed together This embedding can be used to preform data driven catchment similarity analysis The paper is organized as follows Section 2 Methods describes our LSTM based model the data the benchmark hy dr o logical models and the experimental design Section 3 Results presents our modelling results the benchmarking results and the results of our embedding layer analysis Section 4 Discussion and Conclusion reviews certain implications of our model and results and summarizes the advantages of using data driven methods for extracting information from catchment observable s for regional modeling,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Neural networks have become an increasingly popular tool for solving many real-world problems. They are a general framework for differentiable optimization which includes many other machine learning approaches as special cases. In this thesis we build a category-theoretic formalism around a class of neural networks exemplified by CycleGAN. CycleGAN is a collection of neural networks, closed under composition, whose inductive bias is increased by enforcing composition invariants, i.e. cycle-consistencies. Inspired by Functorial Data Migration, we specify the interconnection of these networks using a categorical schema, and network instances as set-valued functors on this schema. We also frame neural network architectures, datasets, models, and a number of other concepts in a categorical setting and thus show a special class of functors, rather than functions, can be learned using gradient descent. We use the category-theoretic framework to conceive a novel neural network architecture whose goal is to learn the task of object insertion and object deletion in images with unpaired data. We test the architecture on three different datasets and obtain promising results.",This thesis aims to bridge two seemingly distinct ideas category theory and deep learning In doing so we take a collection of abstractions in deep learning and formalize the notation in categorical terms This allows us to begin to consider a formal theory of gradient based learning in the fun ctor space We package a notion of the interconnection of networks as a free category Free G on some graph G and specify any equivalences between networks as relations between mor p his msas a quotient category Free G Given such a category which we call a schema inspired by Spi vak 2010 we specify the architectures of its networks as a fun ctor Arch Were as on about various other notions found in deep learning such as datasets embedding s and parameter spaces The training process is associated with an indexed family of fun ctor s H Free G Set T where T is the number of training steps and p is some choice pi i 1 i of a parameter for that architecture at the training step i Analogous to standard neural networks we start with a randomly initialized H and p iterative ly update it using gradient descent Our optimization is guided by two objectives These objectives arise as a natural generalization of those found in Zhu et al 2017 One of them is the adversarial objective them in max objective found in any Generative Adversarial Network The other one is a generalization of the cycle consistency loss which we call path equivalence loss Although mathematically abstract this approach yields useful insights Our formulation provides maximum generality i it enables learning with unpaired data as it does not impose any constraints on ordering or pairing of the sets in a category and ii although specialized to generative models in the domain of computer vision the approach is domain independent and general enough to hold in any domain of interest such as sound text or video We show that for specific choices of Free G and the data set we recover GAN Goodfellow et al 2014 and CycleGAN Zhu et al 2017 Furthermore a novel neural network architecture capable of learning to remove and insert objects into an image with unpaired data is proposed We outline its categorical perspective and show it in action by testing it on three different datasets,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"A latent function decomposition method is proposed for forecasting the capacity of lithium-ion battery cells. The method uses the Multi-Output Gaussian Process, a generative machine learning framework for multi-task and transfer learning. The MCGP decomposes the available capacity trends from multiple battery cells into latent functions. The latent functions are then convolved over kernel smoothers to reconstruct and/or forecast capacity trends of the battery cells. Besides the high prediction accuracy the proposed method possesses, it provides uncertainty information for the predictions and captures nontrivial cross-correlations between capacity trends of different battery cells. These two merits make the proposed MCGP a very reliable and practical solution for applications that use battery cell packs. The MCGP is derived and compared to benchmark methods on an experimental lithium-ion battery cells data.

"Over the past years, the amount of online offensive speech has been growing steadily. To successfully cope with it, machine learning are applied. However, ML-based techniques require sufficiently large annotated datasets. In the last years, different datasets were published, mainly for English. In this paper, we present a new dataset for Portuguese, which has not been in focus so far. The dataset is composed of 5,668 tweets. For its annotation, we defined two different schemes used by annotators with different levels of expertise. Firstly, non-experts annotated the tweets with binary labels ({`}hate{'} vs. {`}no-hate{'}). Secondly, expert annotators classified the tweets following a fine-grained hierarchical multiple label scheme with 81 hate speech categories in total. The inter-annotator agreement varied from category to category, which reflects the insight that some types of hate speech are more subtle than others and that their detection depends on personal perception. This hierarchical annotation scheme is the main contribution of the presented work, as it facilitates the identification of different types of hate speech and their intersections. To demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset, we carried a baseline classification experiment with pre-trained word embeddings and LSTM on the binary classified data, with a state-of-the-art outcome.",in the task of automatic hate grained As we will see below our annotation pro speech detection and adding demographic in for ce dure with the fine grained schema is similar to mati on leads to little improvement in the per for that of Was eem and Ho vy 2016 man ce of the classification model 2 3 Classification methods Offensive Language Data set Davidson et al Different studies conclude that deep learning ap 2017 annotated a data set 3 with 14 510 tweets in p roaches outperform classical machine learning English using the classes Hate Offensive and algorithms in the task of hate speech detection Neither Regarding the collection of the mes see e g Meh dad and Te tre aul t 2016 Park and sages they started with an English hate speech Fung 2017 Del Vigna et al 2017 Pits ili set al lexicon compiled by Hate base org searching for 2018 Fount a et al 2018 Gamba ck and Sik dar tweets that contained terms from this lexicon The 2017 For instance Bad jati ya et al 2017 com outcome was a collection of tweets written by p are the use of different types of neural networks 33 458 Twitter users The collected tweets were CNN LSTM and deep learning libraries such as completed by further follow up tweets of these Fast Text with the use of classical machine learn users which resulted in a corpus of 85 4 million ing techniques and experiment with different types tweets Finally from this corpus a random sample of word embedding s The setup that achieved of 25 000 tweets containing terms from the lex the best performance consists of the combination icon has been extracted and manually annotated of deep techniques with standard ML class if i ers by Crowd Flower workers Three or more work and more precisely of embedding s learned by an ers from Crowd Flower annotated each message LSTM model combined with gradient boosted de The majority voting was used to assign a label to c is ion trees We will follow a similar methodology each tweet Tweets that did not have a majority for classification class were discarded This resulted in a sample of 24 802 labeled tweets The inter an not at or agree 3 Message Collection ment score provided by Crowd Flower was 92 Our overall approach to message collection is out However a total percentage of only 5 of tweets lined in Figure 1 In what follows we introduce in were labeled as hate speech by the majority of the detail the individual steps workers Use of Keywords and Profiles We used Twit Portuguese News Comments Data set de Pelle ter s search API for keywords and profiles because and Moreira 2017 collected a data set 4 with 1 250 both can be complementary as message sources random comments from the Globo news site on With the first we access a wider range of tweets politics and sports news Each comment was from different profiles but we restrict the search annotated by three an not at or s who were asked to specific words or expressions that indicate hate to indicate whether it contained racism sex With the second we obtain more spontaneous is m homophobia xenophobia religious in discourse but from a more restricted number of tolerance or cursing Cursing was the most users frequent label while the other labels had few in Hate related keywords We used Twitter s stances in the corpus Regarding the an not at or API search feature to look for keywords and 3 https g it hub com t davidson hate s hash tags related to hate speech such as fu f as pee ch and offensive language sap at a o dyke or Lugar De Mulher E NaCo z 4 https g it hub com rogers de pelle Off Com BR in ha womens Place Is In The Kitchen Pages and key wo ds Crawling in Twitter Tweets Filtering Tweets Sampling enumeration Keywords related Hate profiles with hate speech Figure 1 Method for message collection Hate related profiles Using the profile 3 000 We decided then to use a maximum of 200 search API we query with words like o dio tweets per search instance in order to keep a more hate disc ur so de o dio hate speech and diverse source of tweets of ens ivo offensive in order to find accounts Final Data set Our final data set contains 5 668 that post hateful messages In Portuguese tweets containing content from 1 156 different there are social media users whose profile users The majority of the tweets more than 95 is built specifically for sharing hateful con are from January February and March of 2017 tent against certain minorities We collect the messages from those accounts with the ex,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Applying machine learning to molecules is challenging because of their natural representation as graphs rather than vectors.Several architectures have been recently proposed for deep learning from molecular graphs, but they suffer from informationbottlenecks because they only pass information from a graph node to its direct neighbors. Here, we introduce a more expressiveroute-based multi-attention mechanism that incorporates features from routes between node pairs. We call the resulting methodGraph Informer. A single network layer can therefore attend to nodes several steps away.

"Objective: Schizophrenia seriously affects the quality of life. To date, both simple (linear discriminant analysis) and complex (deep neural network) machine learning methods have been utilized to identify schizophrenia based on functional connectivity features. The existing simple methods need two separate steps (i.e., feature extraction and classification) to achieve the identification, which disables simultaneous tuning for the best feature extraction and classifier training. The complex methods integrate two steps and can be simultaneously tuned to achieve optimal performance, but these methods require a much larger amount of data for model training. Methods: To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, we proposed a multi-kernel capsule network (MKCapsnet), which was developed by considering the brain anatomical structure. Kernels were set to match with partition sizes of brain anatomical structure in order to capture interregional connectivities at the varying scales. With the inspiration of widely-used dropout strategy in deep learning, we developed vector dropout in the capsule layer to prevent overfitting of the model. Results: The comparison results showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we compared performances using different parameters and illustrated the routing process to reveal characteristics of the proposed method. Conclusion: MKCapsnet is promising for schizophrenia identification. Significance: Our study not only proposed a multi-kernel capsule network but also provided useful information in the parameter setting, which is informative for further studies using a capsule network for neurophysiological signal classification.",network MK Caps net which was developed by considering the 1 18 However these complex methods require a large brain anatomical structure Kernels were set to match with partition sizes of brain anatomical structure in order to capture amount of data for model training in order to reach such better inter regional connect iv i ties at the varying scales With the performance In practice the scale of available data is usually inspiration of widely used dropout strategy in deep learning we not enough to meet the requirement due to a variety of factors developed vector dropout in the capsule layer to prevent including a limited number of participants and expensive cost over fitting of the model Results The comparison results showed in data collection that the proposed method outperformed the state of the art Very recently a new type of network called capsule neural methods Besides we compared performances using different parameters and illustrated the routing process to reveal network was proposed by Sab our et al which does not require characteristics of the proposed method Conclusion MK Caps net huge data for model training and could achieve good is promising for schizophrenia identification Significance Our performance 23 Capsule neural network was proposed to study not only proposed a multi kernel Capsule Network but also initially aim for classifying handwritten digits of postcodes and provided useful information in the parameter setting which is has now been extended to image recognition and text mining informative for further studies using a Capsule Network for 24 30 All these studies demonstrated that capsule neural neuro physiological signal classification network has advantages over other methods For instance Index Terms Multi Kernel Capsule Network Schizophrenia capsule neural network outperformed convolutional neural Diagnosis Functional Connectivity fMRI Deep Learning network CNN in the recognition of brain tumour types based on the data of magnetic resonance imaging MRI 31 Although the capsule neural network was very successful in the,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"After admission to emergency department (ED), patients with critical illnesses are transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) due to unexpected clinical deterioration occurrence. Identifying such unplanned ICU transfers is urgently needed for medical physicians to achieve two-fold goals: improving critical care quality and preventing mortality. A priority task is to understand the crucial rationale behind diagnosis results of individual patients during stay in ED, which helps prepare for an early transfer to ICU. Most existing prediction studies were based on univariate analysis or multiple logistic regression to provide one-size-fit-all results. However, patient condition varying from case to case may not be accurately examined by the only judgment. In this study, we present a new decision tool using a mathematical optimization approach aiming to automatically discover rules associating diagnostic features with high-risk outcome (i.e., unplanned transfers) in different deterioration scenarios. We consider four mutually exclusive patient subgroups based on the principal reasons of ED visits: infections, cardiovascular/respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and neurological/other diseases at a suburban teaching hospital.

"Quantum algorithms can enhance machine learning in different aspects. Here, we study quantum-enhanced least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM). Firstly, a novel quantum algorithm that uses continuous variable to assist matrix inversion is introduced to simplify the algorithm for quantum LS-SVM, while retaining exponential speed-up. Secondly, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical version for sparse solutions of LS-SVM. By encoding a large dataset into a quantum state, a much smaller transformed dataset can be extracted using quantum matrix toolbox, which is further processed in classical SVM. We also incorporate kernel methods into the above quantum algorithms, which uses both exponential growth Hilbert space of qubits and infinite dimensionality of continuous variable for quantum feature maps.

"Dialogue act (DA) classification has been studied for the past two decades and has several key applications such as workflow automation and conversation analytics. Researchers have used, to address this problem, various traditional machine learning models, and more recently deep neural network models such as hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. In this paper, we introduce a new model architecture, directed-acyclic-graph LSTM (DAG-LSTM) for DA classification. A DAG-LSTM exploits the turn-taking structure naturally present in a multi-party conversation, and encodes this relation in its model structure. Using the STAC corpus, we show that the proposed method performs roughly 0.8% better in accuracy and 1.2% better in macro-F1 score when compared to existing methods.

"Automatic medical report generation from chest X-ray images is one possibility for assisting doctors to reduce their workload. However, the different patterns and data distribution of normal and abnormal cases can bias machine learning models. Previous attempts did not focus on isolating the generation of the abnormal and normal sentences in order to increase the variability of generated paragraphs. To address this, we propose to separate abnormal and normal sentence generation by using two different word LSTMs in a hierarchical LSTM model. We conduct an analysis on the distinctiveness of generated sentences compared to the BLEU score, which increases when less distinct reports are generated. We hope our findings will help to encourage the development of new metrics to better verify methods of automatic medical report generation.",However abnormalities are more important and more difficult to detect given the small number of examples In this work we address this issue with a new architecture which can distinguish between generating abnormal or normal sentences Furthermore common machine translation metrics such as BLEU 14 may not be the best choice when even one word such as no contained in a paragraph can make a huge difference for the indication and findings Also calculating these metrics over an imbalanced data set raises the issue that sentences about normal cases are over weighted and results in less diversity in the generated reports We examine these issues of common machine translation metrics when used on a data set of medical reports such as in our work Our contributions 1 We annotate each sentence of a public data set with abnormal labels and 2 use these labels to train a new hierarchical LSTM with dual word LS TMs combined with an abnormal sentence predictor to reduce the data bias 3 We analyze the correlation between machine translation metrics and the variability in generated reports and find that a high score calculated over a data set does not necessarily imply a result to rely on,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"The advancement of machine learning algorithms has opened a wide scope for vibration-based SHM (Structural Health Monitoring). Vibration-based SHM is based on the fact that damage will alter the dynamic properties viz., structural response, frequencies, mode shapes, etc of the structure. The responses measured using sensors, which are high dimensional in nature, can be intelligently analyzed using machine learning techniques for damage assessment. Neural networks employing multilayer architectures are expressive models capable of capturing complex relationships between input-output pairs but do not account for uncertainty in network outputs. A BNN (Bayesian Neural Network) refers to extending standard networks with posterior inference. It is a neural network with a prior distribution on its weights. Deep learning architectures like CNN (Convolutional neural network) and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) are good candidates for representation learning from high dimensional data. The advantage of using CNN over multi-layer neural networks is that they are good feature extractors as well as classifiers, which eliminates the need for generating hand-engineered features. LSTM networks are mainly used for sequence modeling. This paper presents both a Bayesian multi-layer perceptron and deep learning-based approach for damage detection and location identification in beam-like structures. Raw frequency response data simulated using finite element analysis is fed as the input of the network. As part of this, frequency response was generated for a series of simulations in the cantilever beam involving different damage scenarios.

"Financial markets are complex environments that produce enormous amounts of noisy and non-stationary data. One fundamental problem is online portfolio selection, the goal of which is to exploit this data to sequentially select portfolios of assets to achieve positive investment outcomes while managing risks. Various algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem in fields such as finance, statistics and machine learning, among others. Most of the methods have parameters that are estimated from backtests for good performance. Since these algorithms operate on non-stationary data that reflects the complexity of financial markets, we posit that adaptively tuning these parameters in an intelligent manner is a remedy for dealing with this complexity. In this paper, we model the mapping between the parameter space and the space of performance metrics using a Gaussian process prior. We then propose an oracle based on adaptive Bayesian optimization for automatically and adaptively configuring online portfolio selection methods.

"Systematic reviews, which summarize and synthesize all the current research in a specific topic, are a crucial component to academia. They are especially important in the biomedical and health sciences, where they synthesize the state of medical evidence and conclude the best course of action for various diseases, pathologies, and treatments. Due to the immense amount of literature that exists, as well as the output rate of research, reviewing abstracts can be a laborious process. Automation may be able to significantly reduce this workload. Of course, such classifications are not easily automated due to the peculiar nature of written language. Machine learning may be able to help. This paper explored the viability and effectiveness of using machine learning modelling to classify abstracts according to specific exclusion/inclusion criteria, as would be done in the first stage of a systematic review. The specific task was performing the classification of deciding whether an abstract is a randomized control trial (RCT) or not, a very common classification made in systematic reviews in the healthcare field. Random training/testing splits of an n=2042 dataset of labelled abstracts were repeatedly created (1000 times in total), with a model trained and tested on each of these instances. A Bayes classifier as well as an SVM classifier were used, and compared to non-machine learning, simplistic approaches to textual classification. An SVM classifier was seen to be highly effective, yielding a 90% accuracy, as well as an F1 score of 0.84, and yielded a potential workload reduction of 70%. This shows that machine learning has the potential to significantly revolutionize the abstract screening process in healthcare systematic reviews.",We summarize the results of our algorithm below and expand on the implications in the discussion Table 1 Confusion matrix of nuclear algorithm in format mean std dev PREDICTED NOT RCT L NOT 296 85 8 07 0 00 0 00 A U T C RCT 112 15 8 07 0 00 0 00 A Table 2 Confusion matrix of basic algorithm in format mean std dev PREDICTED NOT RCT L NOT 257 06 8 83 39 79 5 26 A U T C RCT51 78 6 33 60 37 6 32 A Table 3 Confusion matrix of Bayes machine learning algorithm in format mean std dev PREDICTED NOT RCT L NOT 296 07 8 00 0 78 0 84 A U T C RCT 88 25 10 19 23 90 4 09 A Table 4 Confusion matrix of SVM machine learning algorithm in format mean std dev PREDICTED NOT RCT L NOT 272 80 8 71 24 05 4 66 A U T C RCT 14 09 3 73 98 06 7 83 A Table 5 Summary performance statistics of different algorithms Accuracy and F 1 score range from 0 to 1 Algorithm Accuracy mean std dev F 1 score mean std dev Nuclear 0 7258 0 0197 N A Basic 0 7761 0 0190 0 5678 0 0365 Bayes 0 7823 0 0247 0 3498 0 0590 SVM 0 9068 0 0132 0 8367 0 0238 Figure 2 Summary performance statistics of different algorithms Error bars show standard deviation,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"In machine learning and other fields, suggesting a good solution to a problem is usually a harder task than evaluating the quality of such a solution. This asymmetry is the basis for a large number of selection oriented methods that use a generator system to guess a set of solutions and an evaluator system to rank and select the best solutions. This work examines the use of this approach to the problem of panoptic image segmentation and class agnostic parts segmentation. The generator/evaluator approach for this case consists of two independent convolutional neural nets: a generator net that suggests variety segments corresponding to objects, stuff and parts regions in the image, and an evaluator net that chooses the best segments to be merged into the segmentation map. The result is a trial and error evolutionary approach in which a generator that guesses segments with low average accuracy, but with wide variability, can still produce good results when coupled with an accurate evaluator. The generator consists of a Pointer net that receives an image and a point in the image, and predicts the region of the segment containing the point. Generating and evaluating each segment separately is essential in this case since it demands exponentially fewer guesses compared to a system that guesses and evaluates the full segmentation map in each try. The classification of the selected segments is done by an independent region-specific classification net. This allows the segmentation to be class agnostic and hence, capable of segmenting unfamiliar categories that were not part of the training set. The method was examined on the COCO Panoptic segmentation benchmark and gave results comparable to those of the basic semantic segmentation and Mask-RCNN methods. In addition, the system was used for the task of splitting objects of unseen classes (that did not appear in the training set) into parts.",when coupled with an accurate eva lu at or The generator consists of a Pointer net that receives an image and a point in the image and predicts the region of the segment containing the point Generating and evaluating each segment separately is essential in this case since it demands exponentially fewer guesses compared to a system that guesses and evaluates the full segmentation map in each try The classification of the selected segments is done by an independent region specific classification net This allows the segmentation to be class agnostic and hence capable of segmenting unfamiliar categories that were not part of the training set The method was examined on the COCO Pan optic segmentation benchmark and gave results comparable to those of the basic semantic segmentation and Mask RCNN methods In addition the system was used for the task of splitting objects of unseen classes that did not appear in the training set into parts 1 sagi e ppel gmail com 2 alan a spur u com Code and trained models for pan optic and parts segmentation are available here pan optic and here parts,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Machine learning techniques for road networks hold the potential to facilitate many important transportation applications. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are neural networks that are capable of leveraging the structure of a road network by utilizing information of, e.g., adjacent road segments. While state-of-the-art GCNs target node classification tasks in social, citation, and biological networks, machine learning tasks in road networks differ substantially from such tasks. In road networks, prediction tasks concern edges representing road segments, and many tasks involve regression. In addition, road networks differ substantially from the networks assumed in the GCN literature in terms of the attribute information available and the network characteristics. Many implicit assumptions of GCNs do therefore not apply. We introduce the notion of Relational Fusion Network (RFN), a novel type of GCN designed specifically for machine learning on road networks. In particular, we propose methods that outperform state-of-the-art GCNs on both a road segment regression task and a road segment classification task by 32-40% and 21-24%, respectively. In addition, we provide experimental evidence of the short-comings of state-of-the-art GCNs in the context of road networks: unlike our method, they cannot effectively leverage the road network structure for road segment classification and fail to outperform a regular multi-layer perceptron.",5 5 1 Cases We select the two regions shown in Fig 4 First we We run ten experiments for each model and report the mean per examine the case in Fig 4 a which shows an expanded view of the form ance with standard deviations in Table 2 The GAT algorithm three way intersection from Fig 1 The segments DE and DF com can become unstable during training 12 and we observed this pri sea busy transportation region that connects different residential phenomenon on one out of the ten runs on the driving speed es regions The segments AB CB and BD are exits from one such t imation task The algorithm did not converge on this run and is residential region This case is characterized by the sharp boundary therefore excluded from the results shown in Table 2 Note that between these two regions as indicated by the colors on the figure when reading Table 2 low values and high values are desirable for The A Band BD segments form part of the street Dan alien We driving speed estimation and speed limit classification respectively therefore refer to this case as Dan alien As shown in Table 2 our relational fusion network variants Next we examine the boundary region between the ordinary city outperform all baselines on both driving speed estimation and speed segments and the motorway segments shown in Fig 4 b Here seg limit classification The best RF N variant outperforms the state ment sGI HI IJ and JK are city roads and J Land LM are motorway of the art graph convolutional approaches i e GraphS AGE and segments This case is characterized by the steep increase in driving Graph Convolutional Networks for Road Networks Table 3 Predicted and ground truth driving speeds from the sub networks shown in Fig 4 a and Fig 4 b Scores are calc u late d for each sub network,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Adversarial machine learning is a well-studied field of research where an adversary causes predictable errors in a machine learning algorithm through precise manipulation of the input. Numerous techniques have been proposed to harden machine learning algorithms and mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks. Of these techniques, adversarial training, which augments the training data with adversarial samples, has proven to be an effective defense with respect to a certain class of attacks. However, adversarial training is computationally expensive and its improvements are limited to a single model. In this work, we take a first step toward creating a model-agnostic adversarial defense. We propose Adversarially-Trained Autoencoder Augmentation (AAA), the first model-agnostic adversarial defense that is robust against certain adaptive adversaries. We show that AAA allows us to achieve a partially model-agnostic defense by training a single autoencoder to protect multiple pre-trained classifiers; achieving adversarial performance on par or better than adversarial training without modifying the classifiers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AAA can be used to create a fully model-agnostic defense for MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets by improving the adversarial performance of a never before seen pre-trained classifier by at least 45% with no additional training. Finally, using a natural image corruption dataset, we show that our approach improves robustness to naturally corrupted images,which has been identified as strongly indicative of true adversarial robustness.",when transferred to a non native transfer class i fier Upon further examination we observed that the reconstructions of the A E trained using the cross entropy loss were visually unrecognizable Table 3 We speculate that these reconstructions are features lying on an abstract feature space that result in good performance specific to the native class if i ers Input L L L L xen t mse xen t mse Table 3 Visualization of the output of the A E trained using cross entropy loss L xen t reconstruction loss L and their combination L L The addition of L mse xen t mse mse to our training objective visually balances the abstract representations learned by L xen t Thus to regularize the A Eso it does not over fit to the native class if i ers we added a standard reconstruction loss as an additional loss term In Table 3 we see that the additional term serves to balance the abstract representation learned by training on cross entropy only pushing them closer to the natural data manifold Formally let B cid 101 be a batch of m adversarial images x cid 101 1 x cid 101 m corresponding to batch B x 1 x m of natural images sampled from p train We obtain B cid 101 from B by solving the maximization problem in Eq using PG D Let J B cid 101 be a cost function for the mean of the adversarial loss defined in Eq computed over the batch B cid 101 Our training objective updates A E parameters while keeping class i fier parameters constant so as to minimize the following m 1 cid 88 cid 16 cid 17 2 J B cid 101 m G x cid 101 i x i 3 i 1 where is a constant that we use to balance the magnitudes of the two losses In the remainder of the paper we refer adversarial cross entropy loss reconstruction loss and their combination Eq asL L and L L respectively mse xen t xen t mse Towards Model Agnostic Adversarial Defenses 11 Experimental Setup To demonstrate that AAA is black box compatible we re place the native class i fier in our pipeline attest time with another class i fier which was independently trained on the same data as the native class i fier We refer to this class i fier as the transfer class i fier and we chose it to have considerably different architecture than its native counterpart Note that we only have black box access to the transfer class i fier To evaluate the robustness of our defense we attack both the native and the transfer AAA models in an end to end manner using the PG D attack and demonstrate performance of AAA model on theM NIST and Fashion M NIST datasets 18 31 We do not include CI FAR 10 since our experiments didn t yield a robust model agnostic defense indicating further improvements are required For the M NIST experiments were move Model C from the previous section from the native Ensemble and treat it as the transfer class i fier For the Fashion M NIST experiments we use the class i fier provided by Zheng et al 9 as the native class i fier and a class i fier containing only fully connected layers as the transfer class i fier We use the Adam optimizer to adversarial ly train the A E using the three loss functions i e L L and L L while keeping the weights of the native xen t mse xen t mse class i fier frozen We generate adversarial examples at each training iteration using a 40 step L bounded PG D attack with a step size of 0 01 and cid 15 0 3 and cid 15 0 2 respectively We set the initial learning rate at 0 001 and decrease it if the validation loss does not improve over five epochs Evaluation We evaluate all models against two white box attacks For the first attack we used a 100 step L bounded PG D attack with step size of 0 01 and cid 15 0 3 and cid 15 0 2 respectively We perform 50 random restarts for each input so an input is only considered correctly classified if all 50 adversarial ly modified versions are correctly classified For the second attack we used the Carlin i Wagner CW attack 5 The attack finds an adversarial perturbation such that min D x x c L F x 4 where D is the distance function and List he loss function representing class if ica tion performance In our experiments we used L version of the attack with c 100,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Malware currently presents a number of serious threats to computer users. Signature-based malware detection methods are limited in detecting new malware samples that are significantly different from known ones. Therefore, machine learning-based methods have been proposed, but there are two challenges these methods face. The first is to model the full semantics behind the assembly code of malware. The second challenge is to provide interpretable results while keeping excellent detection performance. In this paper, we propose an Interpretable MAlware Detector (I-MAD) that outperforms state-of-the-art static malware detection models regarding accuracy with excellent interpretability. To improve the detection performance, I-MAD incorporates a novel network component called the Galaxy Transformer network that can understand assembly code at the basic block, function, and executable levels. It also incorporates our proposed interpretable feed-forward neural network to provide interpretations for its detection results by quantifying the impact of each feature with respect to the prediction.

"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death across the world in women. Early diagnosis of this type of cancer is critical for treatment and patient care. Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems using convolutional neural networks (CNN) could assist in the classification of abnormalities. In this study, we proposed an ensemble deep learning-based approach for automatic binary classification of breast histology images. The proposed ensemble model adapts three pre-trained CNNs, namely VGG19, MobileNet, and DenseNet. The ensemble model is used for the feature representation and extraction steps. The extracted features are then fed into a multi-layer perceptron classifier to carry out the classification task. Various pre-processing and CNN tuning techniques such as stain-normalization, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and fine-tuning are used to train the model. The proposed method is validated on four publicly available benchmark datasets, i.e., ICIAR, BreakHis, PatchCamelyon, and Bioimaging. The proposed multi-model ensemble method obtains better predictions than single classifiers and machine learning algorithms with accuracies of 98.13%, 95.00%, 94.64% and 83.10% for BreakHis, ICIAR,

"Machine learning in context of physical systems merits a re-examination of the learning strategy. In addition to data, one can leverage a vast library of physical prior models (e.g. kinematics, fluid flow, etc) to perform more robust inference. The nascent sub-field of \emph{physics-based learning} (PBL) studies the blending of neural networks with physical priors. While previous PBL algorithms have been applied successfully to specific tasks, it is hard to generalize existing PBL methods to a wide range of physics-based problems. Such generalization would require an architecture that can adapt to variations in the correctness of the physics, or in the quality of training data. No such architecture exists. In this paper, we aim to generalize PBL, by making a first attempt to bring neural architecture search (NAS) to the realm of PBL. We introduce a new method known as physics-based neural architecture search (PhysicsNAS) that is a top-performer across a diverse range of quality in the physical model and the dataset.",met and the ground truth speed as the metric lower distance is ric lower distance is better The low mismatch level better The low mismatch level corresponds to a random corresponds to a small random initial acceleration range initial friction coefficient in range 0 28 0 32 and the 1 m s 2 1 m s 2 and a small damping factor 0 2 The high mismatch level corresponds to a friction coefficient high mismatch level corresponds to a large acceleration in range 0 45 0 55 The best model is marked in red range 3 m s 2 3 m s 2 and a large damping factor 0 5 and the sub optimal is in blue The best model is marked in red and the sub optimal is in blue,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Industry 4.0 is the latest industrial revolution primarily merging automation with advanced manufacturing to reduce direct human effort and resources. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is an industry 4.0 solution, which facilitates predicting faults in a component or a system powered by state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. However, IoT sensors and deep learning (DL) algorithms, both are known for their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In the context of PdM systems, such attacks can have catastrophic consequences as they are hard to detect due to the nature of the attack. To date, the majority of the published literature focuses on the accuracy of DL enabled PdM systems and often ignores the effect of such attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of IoT sensor attacks on a PdM system. At first, we use three state-of-the-art DL algorithms, specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a turbofan engine using NASA's C-MAPSS dataset. The obtained results show that the GRU-based PdM model outperforms some of the recent literature on RUL prediction using the C-MAPSS dataset. Afterward, we model two different types of false data injection attacks (FDIA) on turbofan engine sensor data and evaluate their impact on CNN, LSTM, and GRU-based PdM systems. The obtained results demonstrate that FDI attacks on even a few IoT sensors can strongly defect the RUL prediction. However, the GRU-based PdM model performs better in terms of accuracy and resiliency. Lastly, we perform a study on the GRU-based PdM model using four different GRU networks with different sequence lengths. Our experiments reveal an interesting relationship between the accuracy, resiliency and sequence length for the GRU-based PdM models.",demonstrate that F DI and fools the system by predicting a delayed asset failure or attacks on even a few I oT sensors can strongly defect the RUL maintenance interval This might incur a significant cost by prediction in all cases However the GRU based PdM model inducing an unplanned failure or loss of human lives in safety performs better in terms of accuracy and resiliency to F DIA Lastly we perform a study on the GRU based PdM model using critical applications 6 8 four different GRU networks with different sequence lengths F DI attacks have already caused many known disastrous Our experiments reveal an interesting relationship between the incidents such as the Northeast blackout of 2003 in the USA accuracy resiliency and sequence length for the GRU based PdM and the Ukrainian power grid attack affecting over 230 000 models people leaving them without electricity for several hours Index Terms deep learning false data injection attack LSTM GRU CNN industry 4 0 Internet of things machine learning Extensive research has been performed on the detection and mitigation of F DI attacks in cyber physical systems CP S,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Computing expected predictions of discriminative models is a fundamental task in machine learning that appears in many interesting applications such as fairness, handling missing values, and data analysis. Unfortunately, computing expectations of a discriminative model with respect to a probability distribution defined by an arbitrary generative model has been proven to be hard in general. In fact, the task is intractable even for simple models such as logistic regression and a naive Bayes distribution. In this paper, we identify a pair of generative and discriminative models that enables tractable computation of expectations, as well as moments of any order, of the latter with respect to the former in case of regression. Specifically, we consider expressive probabilistic circuits with certain structural constraints that support tractable probabilistic inference. Moreover, we exploit the tractable computation of high-order moments to derive an algorithm to approximate the expectations for classification scenarios in which exact computations are intractable. Our framework to compute expected predictions allows for handling of missing data during prediction time in a principled and accurate way and enables reasoning about the behavior of discriminative models. We empirically show our algorithm to consistently outperform standard imputation techniques on a variety of datasets. Finally, we illustrate how our framework can be used for exploratory data analysis.",we adopt PS DD s 15 for the generative circuits PS DD s are a subset of PCs since they also satisfy determinism Although we do not require determinism of generative circuits for moment computation we use PS DD s due to the availability of their learning algorithms On image data however we exploit the already learned and publicly available LC structure in 18 which scores 99 4 accuracy on M NIST being competitive to much larger deep models We learn aPS DD with the same v tree For RCs we adapt the parameter and structure learning of LCs 18 substituting the Logistic Regression objective with a ridge regression during optimization For structure learning of both LCs and RCs we considered up to 100 iterates while monitoring the loss on a held outset For PS DD s we employ the parameter and structure learning of 19 with default parameters and run it up to 1000 iterates until no significant improvement is seen on a held outset Figure 2 shows our method outperforming other regression baselines This can be explained by the fact that it computes the exact expectation while other techniques make restrictive assumptions to approximate the expectation Mean and median imputations effectively assume that the features are independent MICE 6 assumes a fixed dependence formula between the features and as already stated MP E only considers the highest probability term in the expansion of the expectation Additionally as we see in Figure 3 our approximation method for predicted classification using just the first order expansion T g p is able to outperform the predictions of the other competitors,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Sexism, an injustice that subjects women and girls to enormous suffering, manifests in blatant as well as subtle ways. In the wake of growing documentation of experiences of sexism on the web, the automatic categorization of accounts of sexism has the potential to assist social scientists and policy makers in studying and countering sexism better. The existing work on sexism classification, which is different from sexism detection, has certain limitations in terms of the categories of sexism used and/or whether they can co-occur. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the multi-label classification of sexism of any kind(s), and we contribute the largest dataset for sexism categorization. We develop a neural solution for this multi-label classification that can combine sentence representations obtained using models such as BERT with distributional and linguistic word embeddings using a flexible, hierarchical architecture involving recurrent components and optional convolutional ones.

"Choosing the most adequate kernel is crucial in many Machine Learning applications. Gaussian Process is a state-of-the-art technique for regression and classification that heavily relies on a kernel function. However, in the Gaussian Process literature, kernels have usually been either ad hoc designed, selected from a predefined set, or searched for in a space of compositions of kernels which have been defined a priori. In this paper, we propose a Genetic-Programming algorithm that represents a kernel function as a tree of elementary mathematical expressions. By means of this representation, a wider set of kernels can be modeled, where potentially better solutions can be found, although new challenges also arise. The proposed algorithm is able to overcome these difficulties and find kernels that accurately model the characteristics of the data.

"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to deliberately crafted adversarial examples. In the past few years, many efforts have been spent on exploring query-optimisation attacks to find adversarial examples of either black-box or white-box DNN models, as well as the defending countermeasures against those attacks. In this work, we explore vulnerabilities of DNN models under the umbrella of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which has not been investigated before. From the perspective of an MitM adversary, the aforementioned adversarial example attacks are not viable anymore. First, such attacks must acquire the outputs from the models by multiple times before actually launching attacks, which is difficult for the MitM adversary in practice. Second, such attacks are one-off and cannot be directly generalised onto new data examples, which decreases the rate of return for the attacker. In contrast, using generative models to craft adversarial examples on the fly can mitigate the drawbacks. However, the adversarial capability of the generative models, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), has not been extensively studied. Therefore, given a classifier, we investigate using a VAE decoder to either transform benign inputs to their adversarial counterparts or decode outputs from benign VAE encoders to be adversarial examples. The proposed method can endue more capability to MitM attackers. Based on our evaluation, the proposed attack can achieve above 95% success rate on both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, which is better or comparable with state-of-the-art query-optimisation attacks. At the meantime, the attack is 104 times faster than the query-optimisation attacks.",Based on the methods introduced in Section 5 we further investigate how to instantiate such an Mit M attack into The transfer ability of the adversarial examples among real world applications Here in we provide a case study class if i ers has been widely evaluated in previous works about how to launch the Mit M attack towards cloud based 25 30 37 However the transfer ability of generative machine learning API services using MVD Furthermore we models has not been thoroughly looked into In this section discuss a possible adaptive defence against the MVD SUBMITTED TO IEEE TDS C OCTOBER 2019 11,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In this paper, we present a study of the recent advancements which have helped bring Transfer Learning to NLP through the use of semi-supervised training. We discuss cutting-edge methods and architectures such as BERT, GPT, ELMo, ULMFit among others. Classically, tasks in natural language processing have been performed through rule-based and statistical methodologies. However, owing to the vast nature of natural languages these methods do not generalise well and failed to learn the nuances of language. Thus machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and decision trees coupled with traditional models such as Bag-of-Words and N-grams were used to usurp this problem. Eventually, with the advent of advanced recurrent neural network architectures such as the LSTM, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several natural language processing tasks such as text classification and machine translation. We talk about how Transfer Learning has brought about the well-known ImageNet moment for NLP. Several advanced architectures such as the Transformer and its variants have allowed practitioners to leverage knowledge gained from unrelated task to drastically fasten convergence and provide better performance on the target task. This survey represents an effort at providing a succinct yet complete understanding of the recent advances in natural language processing using deep learning in with a special focus on detailing

"Recommender Systems have been widely used to help users in finding what they are looking for thus tackling the information overload problem. After several years of research and industrial findings looking after better algorithms to improve accuracy and diversity metrics, explanation services for recommendation are gaining momentum as a tool to provide a human-understandable feedback to results computed, in most of the cases, by black-box machine learning techniques. As a matter of fact, explanations may guarantee users satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in a system. In this paper, we evaluate how different information encoded in a Knowledge Graph are perceived by users when they are adopted to show them an explanation. More precisely, we compare how the use of categorical information, factual one or a mixture of them both in building explanations, affect explanatory criteria for a recommender system. Experimental results are validated through an A/B testing platform which uses a recommendation engine based on a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder to build users profiles which are in turn exploited to compute recommendation lists and to provide an explanation.",we may argue that the pairwise approach with factual in for Systems ACM 60 66 3 V Bellini A Schiavone T DiNo i a A Rag one and E DiSc i as cio 2018 Computing mati on gets better performance in users satisfaction effectiveness recommendations via a Knowledge Graph aware Autoencoder Ar Xive prints and trust while it outperforms the point wise one in persuasiveness July 2018 ar Xiv cs IR 1807 05006 and transparency when both factual and categorical information 4 Marco de Gem mis Pasquale Lops Catal doMus to Fe deluc i oNard ucc i and G io vann iS emer aro 2015 Semantics Aware Content Based Recommend er Systems are exploited Springer US Boston MA 119 159 To provide an answer toR Q 1 examining the results it turns out 5 Tommaso DiNo i a Roberto Mir izzi Vito Claudio Ost uni David eRo mito and that our Sem Auto provides reliable users descriptions as evidenced Markus Z anker 2012 Linked open data to support content based recommend er systems In Proceedings of the 8 th International Conference on Semantic Systems in the effectiveness metric which gets the lowest value by using a ACM 1 8 pairwise explanation This can be interpreted as a strong signal 6 X in Dong Lei Yu Zhong huo Wu Yu xia Sun Ling feng Yuan and Fang xi Zhang 2017 A Hybrid Collaborative Filtering Model with Deep Structure for Re com that the information encoded in the Autoencoder hidden layer is mender Systems In AAA I 1309 1315 representative of the users preferences because the users is less 7 Xavier Gl or ot and Yo shua Be ng io 2010 Understanding the difficulty of training prone to change her ratings after she read the explanation deep feed forward neural networks In Proceedings of the thirteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics 249 256 As for R Q 2 we can assert that the pairwise approach out per 8 Jonathan L Herlocker JosephA Kon stan and John Riedl 2000 Explaining Col forms the point wise one in all metrics especially in transparency labor at ive Filtering Recommendations In Proceedings of the 2000 ACM Conference because it provides a better justification on how the system ranks on Computer Supported Cooperative Work CSC W 00 ACM New York NY USA 241 250 items according to the importance of the features in the user pro 9 Bart P Kn i jn enburg and Marti j nC Willem sen 2015 Evaluating Recommend er file This lets the user to better understand how her preferences Systems with User Experiments Springer US Boston MA 309 352 10 Catal doMus to Fe deluc i oNard ucc i Pasquale Lops Marco De Gem mis and G io are involved in the recommendation process In fact this has an vann iS emer aro 2016 Ex pLOD A Framework for Explaining Recommendations impact especially for the persuasiveness metric where the pairwise Based on the Linked Open Data Cloud In Proceedings of the 10 th ACM Conference approach has a higher score with respect to the point wise ex plan a on Recommend er Systems Rec S ys 16 ACM New York NY USA 151 154 11 Viv iN a st as e and MichaelS tru be 2008 Decoding Wikipedia Categories for tion thus leading users in consuming an item after they have read Knowledge Acquisition In AAA I Vol 8 1219 1224 the provided explanation 12 Sergio Or am as Vito Claudio Ost uni Tommaso DiNo i a Xavier Serra and Eu geni oDi Sci as cio 2016 Sound and Music Recommendation with Knowledge Graphs ACM Trans In tell Syst Techno l 8 2 Article 21 Oct 2016 21 pages,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In machine learning, statistics, econometrics and statistical physics, cross-validation (CV) is used asa standard approach in quantifying the generalisation performance of a statistical model. A directapplication of CV in time-series leads to the loss of serial correlations, a requirement of preserving anynon-stationarity and the prediction of the past data using the future data. In this work, we proposea meta-algorithm called reconstructive cross validation (rCV ) that avoids all these issues. At first,k folds are formed with non-overlapping randomly selected subsets of the original time-series. Then,we generate k new partial time-series by removing data points from a given fold: every new partialtime-series have missing points at random from a different entire fold. A suitable imputation or asmoothing technique is used to reconstruct k time-series. We call these reconstructions secondarymodels. Thereafter, we build the primary k time-series models using new time-series coming fromthe secondary models. The performance of the primary models are evaluated simultaneously bycomputing the deviations from the originally removed data points and out-of-sample (OSS) data.Full cross-validation in time-series models can be practiced with rCV along with generating learning curves.",in set of predictions w m the error is expressed as g w w p k 1 2 5 g w w m p k X q 1 The total error in rC V is computed as follows 2 6 g g g rC V r p The lower the number the better the generalisation however both g and g should be judged r p seperate ly to detect any anomalies We have choose n g as the multi pli vat ive error of rC V reconstruction and as the prediction errors so that it represents the weighted error More complex schemes to estimate g can be di vised Note that both g and g are test errors rC V r p in a conventional sense while both reconstruction and prediction computations are performed on a Gaussian Process that parameters are fixed i e corresponding to Or nste in U hlen beck processes 2 2 Learning Curves for time series Time series learning curves are not that common 4 This is due to fact that data sample sizes are limited and and the conventional procedure introduces the same issues as mentioned earlier when the direct CV is applied on the time series datasets However with the rC V approach one can build a learning curve L based on different number of folds 2 7 Ler r k g k err err corresponds to the error measure used with different errors over a range of different k values The error terms can be any of the errors defined above g g or g Unlike rC V r p,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become indispensable for solving machine learning tasks in speech recognition, computer vision, and other areas that involve high-dimensional data. A CNN filters the input feature using a network containing spatial convolution operators with compactly supported stencils. In practice, the input data and the hidden features consist of a large number of channels, which in most CNNs are fully coupled by the convolution operators. This coupling leads to immense computational cost in the training and prediction phase. In this paper, we introduce LeanConvNets that are derived by sparsifying fully-coupled operators in existing CNNs. Our goal is to improve the efficiency of CNNs by reducing the number of weights, floating point operations and latency times, with minimal loss of accuracy. Our lean convolution operators involve tuning parameters that controls the trade-off between the network's accuracy and computational costs. These convolutions can be used in a wide range of existing networks, and we exemplify their use in residual networks (ResNets). Using a range of benchmark problems from image classification and semantic segmentation, we demonstrate that the resulting LeanConvNet's accuracy is close to state-of-the-art networks while being computationally less expensive. In our tests, the lean versions of ResNet in most cases outperform comparable reduced architectures such as MobileNets and ShuffleNets.",The lean operators preserve the overall network structure and can thus be applied to a variety of Fig 1 Building blocks of basic Lean ResNet step The 1 1 networks e g residual networks ResNets ResNeXt 30 and spatial grouped convolutions are applied simultaneously 32 which have been two of the most reliable architectures in the literature The following aspects set our work apart from other approaches II PRELIMINARIES AND NOTATION We obtain a new operator as the sum of the grouped and We now introduce our main notation and define the su 1 1 convolution operators a schematic description of a per vised classification and semantic segmentation problems ResNet block with lean convolutions appears in Fig 1 more that we use to validate our methods for more details see 7 details later Using a prototype implementation we show that For brevity we restrict the discussion to images although the handling both operations simultaneously reduces the comp u techniques derived here can also be used for other structured t ation time required to apply the operator Also this design data types such as audio or video data In supervised learning introduces several opportunities for optimization in hardware we are given a set of training data consisting of pairs through its parallelism minimal number of memory accesses y k c k s Rn f Rnc In our case y k is the k th,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In the majority of molecular optimization tasks, predictive machine learning (ML) models are limited due to the unavailability and cost of generating big experimental datasets on the specific task. To circumvent this limitation, ML models are trained on big theoretical datasets or experimental indicators of molecular suitability that are either publicly available or inexpensive to acquire. These approaches produce a set of candidate molecules which have to be ranked using limited experimental data or expert knowledge. Under the assumption that structure is related to functionality, here we use a molecular fragment-based graphical autoencoder to generate unique structural fingerprints to efficiently search through the candidate set. We demonstrate that fragment-based graphical autoencoding reduces the error in predicting physical characteristics such as the solubility and partition coefficient in the small data regime compared to other extended circular fingerprints and string based approaches. We further demonstrate that this approach is capable of providing insight into real world molecular optimization problems, such as searching for stabilization additives in organic semiconductors by accurately predicting 92% of test molecules given 69 training examples. This task is a model example of black box molecular optimization as there is minimal theoretical and experimental knowledge to accurately predict the suitability of the additives.",in orders of An

"Methods for automatic analysis of clinical data are usually targeted towards a specific modality and do not make use of all relevant data available. In the field of male human reproduction, clinical and biological data are not used to its fullest potential. Manual evaluation of a semen sample using a microscope is time-consuming and requires extensive training. Furthermore, the validity of manual semen analysis has been questioned due to limited reproducibility, and often high inter-personnel variation. The existing computer-aided sperm analyzer systems are not recommended for routine clinical use due to methodological challenges caused by the consistency of the semen sample. Thus, there is a need for an improved methodology.

"We present the DeepWiFi protocol, which hardens the baseline WiFi (IEEE 802.11ac) with deep learning and sustains high throughput by mitigating out-of-network interference. DeepWiFi is interoperable with baseline WiFi and builds upon the existing WiFi's PHY transceiver chain without changing the MAC frame format. Users run DeepWiFi for i) RF front end processing; ii) spectrum sensing and signal classification; iii) signal authentication; iv) channel selection and access; v) power control; vi) modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptation; and vii) routing. DeepWiFi mitigates the effects of probabilistic, sensing-based, and adaptive jammers. RF front end processing applies a deep learning-based autoencoder to extract spectrum-representative features. Then a deep neural network is trained to classify waveforms reliably as idle, WiFi, or jammer. Utilizing channel labels, users effectively access idle or jammed channels, while avoiding interference with legitimate WiFi transmissions (authenticated by machine learning-based RF fingerprinting) resulting in higher throughput. Users optimize their transmit power for low probability of intercept/detection and their MCS to maximize link rates used by backpressure algorithm for routing.

"With the increasing usage of radiograph images as a most common medical imaging system for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical studies, it is increasingly becoming a vital factor to use machine learning-based systems to provide reliable information for surgical pre-planning. Segmentation of pelvic bone in radiograph images is a critical preprocessing step for some applications such as automatic pose estimation and disease detection. However, the encoder-decoder style network known as U-Net has demonstrated limited results due to the challenging complexity of the pelvic shapes, especially in severe patients. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task segmentation method based on Mask R-CNN architecture. For training, the network weights were initialized by large non-medical dataset and fine-tuned with radiograph images. Furthermore, in the training process, augmented data was generated to improve network performance. Our experiments show that Mask R-CNN utilizing multi-task learning, transfer learning, and data augmentation techniques achieve 0.96 DICE coefficient, which significantly outperforms the U-Net.

"The study of quantum generative models is well-motivated, not only because of its importance in quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry but also because of the perspective of its implementation on near-term quantum machines. Inspired by previous studies on the adversarial training of classical and quantum generative models, we propose the first design of quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), which has been shown to improve the robustness and the scalability of the adversarial training of quantum generative models even on noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, we propose a definition of the Wasserstein semimetric between quantum data, which inherits a few key theoretical merits of its classical counterpart. We also demonstrate how to turn the quantum Wasserstein semimetric into a concrete design of quantum WGANs that can be efficiently implemented on quantum machines. Our numerical study, via classical simulation of quantum systems, shows the more robust and scalable numerical performance of our quantum WGANs over other quantum GAN proposals. As a surprising application, our quantum WGAN has been used to generate a 3-qubit quantum circuit of ~50 gates that well approximates a 3-qubit 1-d Hamiltonian simulation circuit that requires over 10k gates using standard techniques.",on quantum data either have a unique design specific to the 1 qu bit case 13 23 or suffer from robust training issues discussed below 4 More importantly classical GANs are well known for being delicate and somewhat unstable in training In particular it is known 1 that the choice of the metric between real and fake distributions will be critical for the stability of the performance in the training A few widely used ones such as the Kull back Leib ler KL divergence the Jensen Shannon JS divergence and the total variation or statistical distance are not sensible for learning distributions supported by low dimensional generative models The shortcoming of these metrics will likely carry through to their quantum counterparts and hence quantum GANs based on these metrics will likely suffer from the same weaknesses in training This training issue was not significant in the existing numerical study of quantum GANs in the 1 qu bit case 13 23 However as observed by 4 and us the training issue becomes much more significant when the quantum system scales up even just in the case of a few qu bits To tackle the training issue of classical GANs a lot of research has been conducted on the convergence of training GANs in classical machine learning A seminal work 1 used Wasser stein distance or optimal transport distance 43 as a metric for measuring the distance between real and fake distributions Comparing to other measures such as KL and JS Wasser stein distance is more appealing from optimization perspective because of its continuity and smoothness As a result the corresponding Wasser stein GAN WG AN is promising for improving the training stability of GANs There area lot of subsequent studies on various modifications of the WG AN such as GAN with regularized Wasser stein distance 35 WG AN with en tropic regularize rs 12 38 WG AN with gradient penalty 20 31 relaxed WG AN 21 etc It is known 26 that WG AN and its variants such as 20 have demonstrated improved training stability compared to the original GAN formulation Contributions Inspired by the success of classical Wasser stein GANs and the need of smooth robust and scalable training methods for quantum GANs on quantum data we propose the first design of quantum Wasser stein GANs q W GANs To this end our technical contributions are multi folded In Section 3 we propose a quantum counterpart of the Wasser stein distance denoted by q W P Q between quantum data P and Q inspired by 1 43 We prove that q W is a semi metric i e a metric without the triangle inequality over quantum data and inherits nice properties such as continuity and smoothness of the classical Wasser stein distance We will discuss a few other proposals of quantum Wasser stein distances such as 6 8 10 18 29 32 45 and in particular why most of them are not suitable for the purpose of generating quantum data in GANs We will also discuss the limitation of our proposal of quantum Wasser stein semi metric and hope its successful application in quantum GANs could provide another perspective and motivation to study this topic In Section 4 we show how to add the quantum en tropic regular iz ation to q W to further smooth en the loss function in the spirit of the classical case e g 35 We then show the construction of our regularized quantum Wasser stein GAN q WG AN in Figure 1 and describe the configuration and the parameter iz ation of both the generator and the disc rim in at or Most importantly we show that the evaluation of the loss function and the evaluation of the gradient of the loss function can be in principle efficiently implemented on quantum machines This enables direct applications of classical training methods of GANs such as alternating gradient based optimization to the quantum setting It is a wide belief that classical computation cannot efficiently simulate quantum machines in our case the evaluation of the loss function and its gradient Hence the ability of evaluating them efficiently on quantum machines is critical for its s cal ability In Section 5 we supplement our theoretical results with experimental validations via classical simulation of q WG AN Specifically we demonstrate numerical performance of our q WG AN for quantum systems up to 8 qu bits for pure states and up to 3 qu bits for mixed states i e mixture of pure states Comparing to existing results 4 13 23 our numerical performance is more favorable in both the system size and its numerical stability To give a rough sense a single step in the classical,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"There is increasing interest in using deep learning approach for EEG analysis as there are still rooms for the improvement of EEG analysis in its accuracy. Convolutional long short-term (CNNLSTM) has been successfully applied in time series data with spatial structure through end-to-end learning. Here, we proposed a CNNLSTM based neural network architecture termed EEG_CNNLSTMNet for the classification of EEG signals in response to grating stimuli with different spatial frequencies. EEG_CNNLSTMNet comprises two convolutional layers and one bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. The convolutional layers capture local temporal characteristics of the EEG signal at each channel as well as global spatial characteristics across channels, while the LSTM layer extracts long-term temporal dependency of EEG signals. Our experiment showed that EEG_CNNLSTMNet performed much better at EEG classification than a traditional machine learning approach, i.e. a support vector machine (SVM) with features. Additionally, EEG_CNNLSTMNet outperformed EEGNet, a state-of-art neural network architecture for the intra-subject case. We infer that the underperformance when using an LSTM layer in the inter-subject case is due to long-term dependency characteristics in the EEG signal that vary greatly across subjects. Moreover, the inter-subject fine-tuned classification model using very little data of the new subject achieved much higher accuracy than that trained only on the data from the other subjects. Our study suggests that the fine-tuned inter-subject model can be a potential end-to-end EEG analysis method considering both the accuracy and the required training data of the new subject.",captured

"Some recent studies have suggested using GANs for numeric data generation such as to generate data for completing the imbalanced numeric data. Considering the significant difference between the dimensions of the numeric data and images, as well as the strong correlations between features of numeric data, the conventional GANs normally face an overfitting problem, consequently leads to an ill-conditioning problem in generating numeric and structured data. This paper studies the constrained network structures between generator G and discriminator D in WGAN, designs several structures including isomorphic, mirror and self-symmetric structures. We evaluates the performances of the constrained WGANs in data augmentations, taking the non-constrained GANs and WGANs as the baselines. Experiments prove the constrained structures have been improved in 17/20 groups of experiments. In twenty experiments on four UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets, Australian Credit Approval data, German Credit data, Pima Indians Diabetes data and SPECT heart data facing five conventional classifiers.

do not converge which is a widely discussed disadvantage 9 11 Therefore in the discussion of convergence we only compare the convergence of WG AN and IW GAN about generator G as shown in Figure 5 It can be seen that IW GAN produces smaller initial loss function in Australian Credit Approval German Credit and SPEC T heart three datasets Moreover the initial error of IW GAN is only about 1 10 of WG

convergence speed of Australian Credit Approval and SPEC T heart data set improved slightly and were relatively stable German Credit data set s convergence rate has been slightly reduced In general on Australian Credit Approval data set Pima Indians Diabetes data set and SPEC T Heart data set the initial learning of G of IW GAN is close to the optimal global value Another case on German Credit data set is that although the initial G is not close enough to the optimal value it can quickly approach the optimal value through constraints In summary IW GAN with isomorphic structure can enhance convergence performance f G D and f D G have different constraints performance explained by D GM In one case f G D results in larger optimization steps which leads to fast convergence but the loss function produces oscillation near the convergence point as shown in Figure 6 b The other case is fast approaching the optimal solution although the convergence step is small Both cases reflect the validity of f G D constraints in learning G 17 However we are still studying the network structure and f G D corresponding to its optimization step It is noticeable that the blue line of WG AN in the Figure is lower which means smaller E G loss but not the optimal value and only the feedback error to D smaller That is it does not correspond to the better solution of this iteration 6 From Equation 3 we can see that E G is the latter part but the optimal solution corresponds to the global minimum distribution error that is the whole formula In fact our previous experiments have proved that IW GAN is more effective In this experiment we observe the convergence rate and stability FIGURE 5 Comparison of the convergence of WG AN blue lines and IW GAN red lines about generator GIN a German

different IW GANs with relative isomorphic structures and find that the smaller the difference between the number of nodes in In Figure 6 it can be indicated that the spots represent G and D the higher the effect If the theoretical function the A UC of each data augmentation algorithm under decomposition corresponds to the isomorphism of some various class if i ers in Germany credit data set Moreover sub functions it may also produce promotion which dotted lines represent the trend of different IW GANs It can attracts our attention to design a more effective G D pair in be seen that RF

"Model predictive control allows to provide high performance and safety guarantees in the form of constraint satisfaction. These properties, however, can be satisfied only if the underlying model, used for prediction, of the controlled process is sufficiently accurate. One way to address this challenge is by data-driven and machine learning approaches, such as Gaussian processes, that allow to refine the model online during operation. We present a combination of an output feedback model predictive control scheme and a Gaussian process-based prediction model that is capable of efficient online learning. To this end, the concept of evolving Gaussian processes is combined with recursive posterior prediction updates.

"Negation is an important characteristic of language, and a major component of information extraction from text. This subtask is of considerable importance to the biomedical domain. Over the years, multiple approaches have been explored to address this problem: Rule-based systems, Machine Learning classifiers, Conditional Random Field Models, CNNs and more recently BiLSTMs. In this paper, we look at applying Transfer Learning to this problem. First, we extensively review previous literature addressing Negation Detection and Scope Resolution across the 3 datasets that have gained popularity over the years: the BioScope Corpus, the Sherlock dataset, and the SFU Review Corpus. We then explore the decision choices involved with using BERT, a popular transfer learning model, for this task, and report state-of-the-art results for scope resolution across all 3 datasets. Our model, referred to as NegBERT, achieves a token level F1 score on scope resolution of 92.36 on the Sherlock dataset, 95.68 on the BioScope Abstracts subcorpus, 91.24 on the BioScope Full Papers subcorpus, 90.95 on the SFU Review Corpus, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art systems by a significant margin. We also analyze the model's generalizability to datasets on which it is not trained.",of the pattern evaluations and a few other con They used the fact that rule based systems had to be domain ce pt

made to pass to the next level of the cascade if no had shown that the scope of negation may be difficult to negation was found The cascade they proposed was 3 lev identify if the cues are more than a

regular expression matching with grammatical to use them to come up with better rules decisions thus parsing which allowed the rule based systems to account improving on just rule based systems for

showed that there existed a problem which enabled systems to gain high accuracy namely that negation scopes were frequently annotated as a single span of text delimited by punctuation They pointed out that the Bio scope and SFU Review corpus suffer from this pro b lem while the Sherlock Corpus does not They also im proved upon their previous model Fan cell u et al 2016 BiLSTM by making joint

"Detecting earthquake events from seismic time series has proved itself a challenging task. Manual detection can be expensive and tedious due to the intensive labor and large scale data set. In recent years, automatic detection methods based on machine learning have been developed to improve accuracy and efficiency. However, the accuracy of those methods relies on a sufficient amount of high-quality training data, which itself can be expensive to obtain due to the requirement of domain knowledge and subject matter expertise. This paper is to resolve this dilemma by answering two questions: (1) provided with a limited number of reliable labels, can we use them to generate more synthetic labels; (2) Can we use those synthetic labels to improve the detectability? Among all the existing generative models, the generative adversarial network (GAN) shows its supreme capability in generating high-quality synthetic samples in multiple domains. We designed our model based on GAN. In particular, we studied several different network structures. By comparing the generated results, our GAN-based generative model yields the highest quality. We further combine the dataset with synthetic samples generated by our generative model and show that the detectability of our earthquake classification model is significantly improved than the one trained without augmenting the training set.",in computer vision image analysis and many other domains due to the sig n if i cant ly improved computational power In 2012 AlexNet won the Image Net comp

Detect detection method Wu et al 2019 which is a cascaded region based convolutional neural network designed to capture earth quake events in different sizes while incorporating contextual information to enrich fe a ture s for each proposal and the work of Zhang et al 2019 which implemented a deep learning based earthquake non earthquake classification model with an adaptive thresh old frequency filtering module to achieve superior performance All of the aforementioned neural networks are supervised meaning that they all require an iterative training procedure to learn the characteristic patterns of seismic wave forms from labeled datasets Training these models requires a sufficient amount of la be led data tens of thousands or even millions of records in many cases Ross et al 2018 However in many earthquake detection problems labeled data at this scale is simply not available and would require thousands of hours of human labor from trained se is mic analysts to produce In order to resolve this dilemma we develop a generative model to synthesize realistic labeled waveform data and use them to augment real world train ing data We use a generative adversarial network GAN which is a type of generative model based on an adversarial min max game between two networks generator and disc rim in at or Goodfellow et al 2014 The role of the generator is to synthesize realistic data

component of the wave form data is considered GAN has also been proved to be effective in other geophysical applications such as in version Zhang Lin 2020 Zhong et al 2020 processing Pic etti et al 2019 and interpretation Lu et al 2018 There are multiple variants of GAN the most important for this article being the conditional GAN Mirza Os in der o 2014 which turns the traditional GAN into a con

conditional GAN that can produce synthetic seismic time series While GAN models have been used previously in data augmentation tasks Perez Wang 2017 to our knowledge GAN generated synthetic data has not been applied to data aug ment ation problems for 1 D time series or seismic event detection tasks We validate the quality of synthetic seismic events visually and quantitatively With the promise

"Understanding the principles of causal inference in the visual system has a long history at least since the seminal studies by Albert Michotte. Many cognitive and machine learning scientists believe that intelligent behavior requires agents to possess causal models of the world. Recent ML algorithms exploit the dependence structure of additive noise terms for inferring causal structures from observational data, e.g. to detect the direction of time series; the arrow of time. This raises the question whether the subtle asymmetries between the time directions can also be perceived by humans. Here we show that human observers can indeed discriminate forward and backward autoregressive motion with non-Gaussian additive independent noise, i.e. they appear sensitive to subtle asymmetries between the time directions. We employ a so-called frozen noise paradigm enabling us to compare human performance with four different algorithms on a trial-by-trial basis: A causal inference algorithm exploiting the dependence structure of additive noise terms, a neurally inspired network, a Bayesian ideal observer model as well as a simple heuristic. Our results suggest that all human observers use similar cues or strategies to solve the arrow of time motion discrimination task, but the human algorithm is significantly different from the three machine algorithms we compared it to. In fact, our simple heuristic appears most similar to our human observers.",The following psycho metric functions and Bayesian Credible Intervals CI were calculated with the Beta Binomial Model in P sign if it 4 54 Figure 1 shows the main result of Experiment one The black psycho metric functions show the human data pooled across all ten observers and the coloured curves results for the algorithms on the sametime series seen by our human observers Res Dep in red the neural network in yellow the ideal observer in blue our heuristic in lightblue Data for single observers are shown in Figure A 8 All individual psycho metric functions can be found in figure A 9 and A 10 and the thresholds with credible intervals in table 4 On the one hand humans can indeed detect the direction of a time series for Super Gaussian and Bi modal noise with thresholds r 0 67 95 CI 0 62 0 72 Bi modal andr 1 62 95 CI 1 45 1 81 Super Gaussian The Res Dep algorithm on the other hand performs similar to humans with Bi modal noise threshold r 0 64 95 CI 0 61 0 68 and perhaps marginally better with Super Gaussian noise threshold r 1 48 95 CI 1 4 1 56 2 Algorithmic performance of the neural network and the ideal observer is superior to human andRes Dep performance and both algorithms show remarkably similar results A detailed analysis of the neural network can be found in A 5 Thresholds for the exponents of the Neural Network are r 0 85 95 CI 0 82 0 96 and r 1 19 95 CI 0 98 1 24 for the ideal observer r 0 87 95 CI 0 83 0 96 and r 1 18 95 CI 0 99 1 25 and for the heuristic 2 The best three human observers for Super Gaussian noise had thresholds of r 1 32 1 36 1 38 atleast as sensitive as Res Dep,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables measuring human brain activity, in vivo. Yet, the fMRI hemodynamic response unfolds over very slow timescales (<0.1-1 Hz), orders of magnitude slower than millisecond timescales of neural spiking. It is unclear, therefore, if slow dynamics as measured with fMRI are relevant for cognitive function. We investigated this question with a novel application of Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) and machine learning to fMRI data. We analyzed slowly sampled (1.4 Hz) fMRI data from 1000 healthy human participants (Human Connectome Project database), and applied GPFA to reduce dimensionality and extract smooth latent dynamics. GPFA dimensions with slow (<1 Hz) characteristic timescales identified, with high accuracy (>95%), the specific task that each subject was performing inside the fMRI scanner. Moreover, functional connectivity between slow GPFA latents accurately predicted inter-individual differences in behavioral scores across a range of cognitive tasks. Finally, infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) latent dynamics predicted CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) scores of individual patients, and identified patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would progress to develop Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Slow and infra-slow brain dynamics may be relevant for understanding the neural basis of cognitive function, in health and disease.",We examined the degree of inter subject synchronization with a view to distinguishing task relevant latent dimensions from task irrelevant ones We hypothesized that the strength of inter subject synchronization within each latent dimension would index the task relevance of that dimension For example artifacts such as scanner noise or physiological noise are unlikely to be synchronized across subjects whereas dimensions strongly locked to salient aspects of the task would be highly synchronized To quantify the degree of inter subject synchronization for each latent dimension we computed a synchronization index the average correlation between the template latent time series and the projected latent time series of each of the test subjects A higher synchronization index indicates a higher degree of phase locking or synchronization of the test subjects latent time series with the template time series Slower timescale dimensions exhibited systematically stronger synchronization indices as compared to faster dimensions Fig 2 C shows this trend for working memory task all tasks shown in SI Fig S 2 These results are consistent with the proposal that across tasks faster 1 Hz timescale dimensions reflected scanner artifact and noise and slower 1 Hz

"In this paper, we address the ice-start problem, i.e., the challenge of deploying machine learning models when only a little or no training data is initially available, and acquiring each feature element of data is associated with costs. This setting is representative of the real-world machine learning applications. For instance, in the health care domain, obtaining every single measurement comes with a cost. We propose Icebreaker, a principled framework for elementwise training data acquisition. Icebreaker introduces a full Bayesian Deep Latent Gaussian Model (BELGAM) with a novel inference method, which combines recent advances in amortized inference and stochastic gradient MCMC to enable fast and accurate posterior inference. By utilizing BELGAM’s ability to fully quantify model uncertainty, we also propose two information acquisition functions for imputation and active prediction problems. We demonstrate that BELGAM performs significantly better than previous variational autoencoder (VAE) based models, when the data set size is small, using both machine learning benchmarks and real world recommender systems and health-care applications. Moreover, Icebreaker not only demonstrates improved performance compared to baselines, but it is also capable of achieving better test performance with less training data available.",We evaluate Icebreaker first on benchmark datasets UCI 8 on both imputation and prediction tasks We then consider two real world applications a movie rating imputation task using the Movie Lens data set 10 and b risk prediction in intensive care using the MIMIC data set 17 Experiments Setup and evaluation We compare Icebreaker with a random feature acquisition strategy for training where both P VAE 28 and PA BEL GAMa reused For the imputation task P VAE already achieves excellent results in various datasets compared to traditional methods 28 34 Additionally for the active prediction task we compare Icebreaker to an instance wise active learning method denoted as Row AT in which the data are assumed to be fully observed apart from the target We evaluate the imputation performance by reporting negative log likelihood NLL over the test target For the active prediction task weu seED DI 28 to sequentially select features attest time We report the area under the information curve A UIC 28 for the test set See Figure 5 for an example and the appendix for details A smaller value of A UIC indicates better overall active prediction performance All experiments are averaged over 10 runs and their setting details are in the appendix 5 1 UCI Data Set Imputation Task At each step of Icebreaker we select 50 feature elements from the pool Figure 4 a shows the averaged NLL on the test set as the training set increases Icebreaker outperforms,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In drug-discovery-related tasks such as virtual screening, machine learning is emerging as a promising way to predict molecular properties. Conventionally, molecular fingerprints (numerical representations of molecules) are calculated through rule-based algorithms that map molecules to a sparse discrete space. However, these algorithms perform poorly for shallow prediction models or small datasets. To address this issue, we present SMILES Transformer. Inspired by Transformer and pre-trained language models from natural language processing, SMILES Transformer learns molecular fingerprints through unsupervised pre-training of the sequence-to-sequence language model using a huge corpus of SMILES, a text representation system for molecules. We performed benchmarks on 10 datasets against existing fingerprints and graph-based methods and demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithms in small-data settings where pre-training facilitated good generalization.

"Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is enabling a wide range of smart applications on end devices. However, such convenience comes with a cost of privacy because users have to upload their private data to the cloud. This research aims to provide effective and efficient MLaaS such that the cloud server learns nothing about user data and the users cannot infer the proprietary model parameters owned by the server. This work makes the following contributions. First, it unveils the fundamental performance bottleneck of existing schemes due to the heavy permutations in computing linear transformation and the use of communication intensive Garbled Circuits for nonlinear transformation. Second, it introduces an ultra-fast secure MLaaS framework, CHEETAH, which features a carefully crafted secret sharing scheme that runs significantly faster than existing schemes without accuracy loss. Third, CHEETAH is evaluated on the benchmark of well-known, practical deep networks such as AlexNet and VGG-16 on the MNIST and ImageNet datasets. The results demonstrate more than 100x speedup over the fastest GAZELLE (Usenix Security'18), 2000x speedup over MiniONN (ACM CCS'17) and five orders of magnitude speedup over CryptoNets (ICML'16).

These domains are often utilized as rendezvous points for servers that malware has command and control over. There are many algorithms that are used to generate domains, however many of these algorithms are simplistic and easily detected by traditional machine learning techniques. In this paper, three variants of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are optimized to generate domains which have similar characteristics of benign domains, resulting in domains which greatly evade several state-of-the-art deep learning based DGA classifiers. We additionally provide a detailed analysis into offensive usability for each variant with respect to repeated and existing domain collisions.

"In colored graphs, node classes are often associated with either their neighbors class or with information not incorporated in the graph associated with each node. We here propose that node classes are also associated with topological features of the nodes. We use this association to improve Graph machine learning in general and specifically, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). First, we show that even in the absence of any external information on nodes, a good accuracy can be obtained on the prediction of the node class using either topological features, or using the neighbors class as an input to a GCN. This accuracy is slightly less than the one that can be obtained using content based GCN. Secondly, we show that explicitly adding the topology as an input to the GCN does not improve the accuracy when combined with external information on nodes. However, adding an additional adjacency matrix with edges between distant nodes with similar topology to the GCN does significantly improve its accuracy, leading to results better than all state of the art methods in multiple datasets.",5 1 TOPOLOGY IS CORRELATED WITH CLASS To test that neighbor class and the node self topology as shall be further defined are correlated with the node class we performed two tests We first computed the relative frequency of classes in neighbors given the class of the node p neighbor hasclass i current node hasclass j 4 Fig 2 lower plots In the absence of correlations one would expect a flat value while an absolute correlation would produce an identity matrix In the Cora or Cite seer networks the mass of the diagonal is 60 of the mass compared with an expected 15 To test for the relation between node topology and class we computed the average value of multiple topological features Appendix A 3 for nodes with a given class in the current context manuscripts belonging to a certain field Except for the betweenness centrality the only topological features correlated with class were 3 and 4 small scale motif frequencies To test for that a Kruskal Wallis non parametric test was performed to test for the relation between the node class manuscript field and the distribution of features Over sixty different small scale motifs are associated with the node class Fig 2 upper plots To test that topology and information propagation can be used to classify node classes we introduced the topological features above and the number of neighbors belonging to the training set with a given class as input to a Feed Forward Network see Appendix A 4 These two types of information by themselves can be used to classify the class of nodes quite precisely see Appendix 4,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Euclidean geometry has historically been the typical ""workhorse"" for machine learning applications due to its power and simplicity. However, it has recently been shown that geometric spaces with constant non-zero curvature improve representations and performance on a variety of data types and downstream tasks. Consequently, generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been successfully generalized to elliptical and hyperbolic latent spaces. While these approaches work well on data with particular kinds of biases e.g. tree-like data for a hyperbolic VAE, there exists no generic approach unifying and leveraging all three models. We develop a Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoder, an efficient way to train a VAE whose latent space is a product of constant curvature Riemannian manifolds, where the per-component curvature is fixed or learnable. This generalizes the Euclidean VAE to curved latent spaces and recovers it when curvatures of all latent space components go to 0.",on a specific data set This procedure would most likely be optimal but does not scale well To eliminate this we propose an approximate method we partition our space into 2 dimensional components if the number of dimensions is odd one component will have 3 dimensions We initialize all of them as Euclidean components and train for half the number of maximal epochs we are allowed Then we split the components into 3 approximately equal sized groups and make one group into hyperbolic components one into spherical and the last remains Euclidean We do this by changing the curvature of a component by a very small cid 15 We then train just the encoder decoder maps for a few epochs to stabilize the representations after changing the curvatures Finally we allow learning the curvatures of all non Euclidean components and train for the rest of the allowed epochs The method is not completely general as it never uses components bigger than dimension 2 but the approximation has empirically performed satisfactorily We also do not constrain the curvature of the components to a specific sign in the last stage of training Therefore components may change their type of space from a positively curved to a negatively curved one or vice versa Because of the divergence of points asK 0 for the hyperboloid and hyper sphere the universal curvature VAE assumes the positively curved space is D and the negatively curved space isP In all experiments this universal approach is denoted a sUn,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Societal bias towards certain communities is a big problem that affects a lot of machine learning systems. This work aims at addressing the racial bias present in many modern gender recognition systems. We learn race invariant representations of human faces with an adversarially trained autoencoder model. We show that such representations help us achieve less biased performance in gender classification. We use variance in classification accuracy across different races as a surrogate for the racial bias of the model and achieve a drop of over 40% in variance with race invariant representations.,We evaluate the three models described above on the stratified test splits To reiterate about 88 of the training data are of Class 0 4 Class 1 3 5 Class 2 3 Class 3 and 1 5 Class 4 At a glance we can see from the Table 1 that the accuracy on Class 2 is significantly lower than the average for the Simple CNN model The sense of bias in the model can be captured by variance in the performance of the model across all classes The Simple CNN model has a variance of 11 26 With the weighted loss for the same model the variance is reduced not by a large margin to 10 11 With our method the variance falls down to 6 66 This proves our hypothesis that race invariant representations would indeed make our model less biased Models Simple CNN Simple CNN W L Fader CNN All classes 89 51 88 80 84 83 Class 0 92 41 89 84 85 65 Class 1 91 56 90 25 86 08 Class 2 84 07 83 64 80 90 Class 3 90 93 92 02 87 66 Class 4 88 61 88 27 83 86 Variance 11 26 10 11 6 66 Table 1 Class wise Evaluation Results on the test set Possible improvements and future work This work only provides as proof of concept Note that eventhough the variance has reduced with both weighted loss method and our method the overall accuracy for both models has reduced more so for Fader CNN This can be explained by the fact that with the current training state of Fader Net we cannot guarantee that the adversarial training has only removed the race information from the latent representation As mentioned earlier in the implementation details due to the nature of adversarial training and limited computation resources we could not train the model for too long and had to stop training at disc rim in at or accuracy of 61 eventhough there was a negative trend in the disc rim in at or accuracy We also could not extensively search the hyper parameter space for an optimal point due to computational limitations Further we only explored very naive data augmentation techniques like dynamic horizontal and vertical flips Given that our data set is very small employing a varied set of data augmentation techniques along with some hyper parameter optimization should give much more robust results,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The complex world around us is inherently multimodal and sequential (continuous). Information is scattered across different modalities and requires multiple continuous sensors to be captured. As machine learning leaps towards better generalization to real world, multimodal sequential learning becomes a fundamental research area. Arguably, modeling arbitrarily distributed spatio-temporal dynamics within and across modalities is the biggest challenge in this research area. In this paper, we present a new transformer model, called the Factorized Multimodal Transformer (FMT) for multimodal sequential learning. FMT inherently models the intramodal and intermodal (involving two or more modalities) dynamics within its multimodal input in a factorized manner. The proposed factorization allows for increasing the number of self-attentions to better model the multimodal phenomena at hand; without encountering difficulties during training (e.g. overfitting) even on relatively low-resource setups. All the attention mechanisms within FMT have a full time-domain receptive field which allows them to asynchronously capture long-range multimodal dynamics. In our experiments we focus on datasets that contain the three commonly studied modalities of language, vision and acoustic. We perform a wide range of experiments, spanning across 3 well-studied datasets and 21 distinct labels.

"Monoaural audio source separation is a challenging research area in machine learning. In this area, a mixture containing multiple audio sources is given, and a model is expected to disentangle the mixture into isolated atomic sources. In this paper, we first introduce a challenging new dataset for monoaural source separation called WildMix. WildMix is designed with the goal of extending the boundaries of source separation beyond what previous datasets in this area would allow. It contains diverse in-the-wild recordings from 25 different sound classes, combined with each other using arbitrary composition policies. Source separation often requires modeling long-range dependencies in both temporal and spectral domains. To this end, we introduce a novel trasnformer-based model called Spectro-Temporal Transformer (STT). STT utilizes a specialized encoder, called Spectro-Temporal Encoder (STE). STE highlights temporal and spectral components of sources within a mixture, using a self-attention mechanism. It subsequently disentangles them in a hierarchical manner.

"A remarkable recent discovery in machine learning has been that deep neural networks can achieve impressive performance (in terms of both lower training error and higher generalization capacity) in the regime where they are massively over-parameterized. Consequently, over the past year, the community has devoted growing interest in analyzing optimization and generalization properties of over-parameterized networks, and several breakthrough works have led to important theoretical progress. However, the majority of existing work only applies to supervised learning scenarios and hence are limited to settings such as classification and regression. In contrast, the role of over-parameterization in the unsupervised setting has gained far less attention. In this paper, we study the gradient dynamics of two-layer over-parameterized autoencoders with ReLU activation. We make very few assumptions about the given training dataset (other than mild non-degeneracy conditions). Starting from a randomly initialized autoencoder network, we rigorously prove the linear convergence of gradient descent in two learning regimes, namely: (i) the weakly-trained regime where only the encoder is trained, and (ii) the jointly-trained regime where both the encoder and the decoder are trained. Our results indicate the considerable benefits of joint training over weak training for finding global optima, achieving a dramatic decrease in the required level of over-parameterization. We also analyze the case of weight-tied autoencoders (which is a commonly used architectural choice in practical settings) and prove that in the over-parameterized setting, training such networks from randomly initialized points leads to certain unexpected degeneracies.",in a non negligible change in the network output that exponentially reduces the training loss with iteration count This line of thinking has been subsequently refined and linked to the stability of a special kernel called the neural tangent kernel NT K Jaco t et al 2018 Ar or a et al 2019 a showed that the minimum eigenvalue of the limiting kernel governs both the algorithmic convergence and the generalization performance Despite these exciting results the majority of existing work has focused on supervised settings and hence are limited to tasks such as classification and regression In contrast the role of over parameter iz ation in the unsupervised setting for tasks such as reconstruction de noising and visualization has gained much less attention An early related example in unsupervised learning can be traced back to learning over complete dictionaries with sparse codes Ol s hausen and Field 1997 Another example is the problem of learning mixtures of k well separated spherical Gaussian s where Das gupta and Sc hulman 2007 showed that initializing with O k log k centers enables expectation maximization to correctly recover the k components Interesting but limited progress has been made towards understanding over parameter iz ation for au to encoders a popular class of unsupervised models based on neural networks Zhang et al 2019 provided an extensive study of training highly over parameterized Autoencoders using a single sample They em pir ic ally showed that when learned by gradient descent Autoencoders with different architectures can exhibit two inductive biases memorization i e learning the constant function and generalization i e learning the identity mapping depending on the non linearity and the network depth Radhakrishnan et al 2019 showed that over parameterized Autoencoder learning is empirically biased towards functions that c once n t rate around the training samples and hence exhibits memorization Bu hai et al 2019 empirically showed that over parameter iz ation benefits learning in recovering generative models with single layer latent variables including the sparse coding model However there has been a lack of theoretical evidence that supports these observations Zhang et al 2019 were able to prove a result for a simple one layer linear case while Radhakrishnan et al 2019 also proved the concentration of outputs near the training examples for a single layer network under a data restrictive setting Moreover none of the above papers have rigorously studied the training dynamics of Autoencoder models The loss surface of Autoencoder training was first characterized in Rang amani et al 2017 Subsequently Nguyen et al 2019 proved that under parameterized and suitably initialized auto en coders performed approximate proper parameter learning in the regime of asymptotically many samples building upon techniques in provable dictionary learning cf Ar or a et al 2015 Nguyen et al 2018 Our contributions In this paper we provide the first rigorous analysis of inductive bias of gradient descent and gradient dynamics of over parameterized shallow two layer Autoencoders To examine the inductive bias we use an infinite width approximation to derive the output reconstruction in terms its input For the gradient dynamics we study different training schemes and establish upper bounds on the level of over parameter iz ation under which standard gradient descent starting from randomly initialized weights can linearly converge to global optima provided the training data set obeys some mild assumptions Our specific contributions are as follows,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Constructing accurate and automatic solvers of math word problems has proven to be quite challenging. Prior attempts using machine learning have been trained on corpora specific to math word problems to produce arithmetic expressions in infix notation before answer computation. We find that custom-built neural networks have struggled to generalize well. This paper outlines the use of Transformer networks trained to translate math word problems to equivalent arithmetic expressions in infix, prefix, and postfix notations. In addition to training directly on domain-specific corpora, we use an approach that pre-trains on a general text corpus to provide foundational language abilities to explore if it improves performance. We compare results produced by a large number of neural configurations and find that most configurations outperform previously reported approaches on three of four datasets with significant increases in accuracy of over 20 percentage points.

"Learning with kernels is an important concept in machine learning. Standard approaches for kernel methods often use predefined kernels that require careful selection of hyperparameters. To mitigate this burden, we propose in this paper a framework to construct and learn a data-dependent kernel based on random features and implicit spectral distributions that are parameterized by deep neural networks. The constructed network (called KernelNet) can be applied to deep generative modeling in various scenarios, including two popular learning paradigms in deep generative models, MMD-GAN and implicit Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We show that our proposed kernel indeed exists in applications and is guaranteed to be positive definite. Furthermore, the induced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) can endow the continuity property in weak topology by simple regularization. Extensive experiments indicate that our proposed KernelNet consistently achieves better performance compared to related methods.",of our Implicit Info VAE model on the M NIST data set 27 here and leave other experiments along with detailed settings in the Appendix GIN this experiment we use a network with 1 fully connected hidden layer for both encoder and decoder whose hidden units are set to 400 Bernoulli noises are injected into the encoder by using dropout with a dropout rate of 0 3 At every step 512 random features from the spectral distribution are sampled For fair evaluation we follow 28 and use Annealed Importance Sampling A IS to approximate the negative log likelihood NLL 10 independent A IS chains are used each of which have 1000 intermediate distributions The final results are computed using 5000 random sampled test data The results are shown in Table 3 and some reconstructed and generated images and t s ne visualization are provided in the Appendix G We compare with related models including VAE vanilla VAE from 13 Stein VAE amortized SVG D from 5 SIV I Semi Implicit VAE from 4 Spectral implicit VAE with spectral method for gradient estimation from 29 and Info VAE 18 Note that some models have also reported scores related to NLL in their original paper under different settings which are not directly comparable to ours For fair comparisons were run all the models with the same model structure We denote our Implicit Info VAE with Stein gradient estimator with objective 1 as Info IVAE The models with objective 14 are denoted as Info IVAE R BF Info IVAE I KL and Info IVAE DK where theM MD regularize rs are computed by R BF kernel IK Land Kernel Net respectively Our model obtains the best NLL score among all the models,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Forecasting severe weather conditions is still a very challenging and computationally expensive task due to the enormous amount of data and the complexity of the underlying physics. Machine learning approaches and especially deep learning have however shown huge improvements in many research areas dealing with large datasets in recent years. In this work, we tackle one specific sub-problem of weather forecasting, namely the prediction of thunderstorms and lightning. We propose the use of a convolutional neural network architecture inspired by UNet++ and ResNet to predict thunderstorms as a binary classification problem based on satellite images and lightnings recorded in the past. We achieve a probability of detection of more than 94% for lightnings within the next 15 minutes while at the same time minimizing the false alarm ratio compared to previous approaches.",The main metrics for our evaluation are True Positive Rate T PR True Negative Rate T NR Accuracy and False Alarm Ratio FAR whose formulas are given in Appendix C Figure 2 a depicts the accumulated results overall four cross validation test sets The RUN et bars correspond to our newly tested architecture whereas RF 129 and RF 66 are Random Forests as described in our previous work 16 The Random Forests were trained on a balanced subset of the data As the ratio of positive samples is 0 066 the data set has approximately 1 500 negative samples per positive sample and we can re compute the accuracy and FAR overall data by re weighting the T NR with this factor To compare the impact of residual blocks in the U-Net architecture we also trained a standard U-Net architecture with the same size as our new residual version We eliminated the first 1 1 convolution layer i e a layer that simply scales the input linearly as well as the skip connection leaving a basic building block consisting of two convolutions normalization s and activation s each Our results indicate that U-Net and RUN et in general achieve a similar performance compared to Random Forests However in a direct comparison they tend to predict the negative class better resulting in a lower FAR which highly depends on the number of false positives in such an extremely imbalanced data set Reducing the FAR without sacrificing too much T PR is essential for the operational use as humans tend to mistrust systems that often fail In addition convolutional neural networks offer the advantage of directly processing image slices instead of single pixel values as compared to Random Forests eliminating the need of additional preprocessing steps Comparing the standard U-Net architecture with our modified version RUN et we can see that our model outperforms the standard architecture by 3 5 in term sofT PR We evaluated the test set every 5 epochs which allows us to have a closer look at the development of the T PR and T NR during the model training Figure 2 b indicates that although both models achieve a similar overall performance RUN et converges much faster which allows for a faster training,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Childhood obesity is a major public health challenge. Early prediction and identification of the children at a high risk of developing childhood obesity may help in engaging earlier and more effective interventions to prevent and manage obesity. Most existing predictive tools for childhood obesity primarily rely on traditional regression-type methods using only a few hand-picked features and without exploiting longitudinal patterns of children data. Deep learning methods allow the use of high-dimensional longitudinal datasets. In this paper, we present a deep learning model designed for predicting future obesity patterns from generally available items on children medical history. To do this, we use a large unaugmented electronic health records dataset from a large pediatric health system. We adopt a general LSTM network architecture which are known to better represent the longitudinal data. We train our proposed model on both dynamic and static EHR data. Our model is used to predict obesity for ages between 2-20 years. We compared the performance of our LSTM model with other machine learning methods that aggregate over sequential data and ignore temporality. To add interpretability, we have additionally included an attention layer to calculate the attention scores for the timestamps and rank features of each timestamp.",collected in E HR datasets is generally huge This leads to a very large feature input space for a prediction model despite each visit having only a very small subset of total unique conditions medications procedures and measurements recorded The models we present in this study try to address these issues effectively The E HR data used in this work consists of the records of patients diagnosed conditions prescribed medications performed procedures and recorded laboratory results in any visit Compared to existing obesity predictive models in this domain our model uses a much larger data set 44 million rows with 68 003 unique patients for training and considers a larger set of con founders for predicting outcomes Our model is based only on the standard E HR data already available in many hospitals Besides only using the existing data on standard pediatric E HRs another key difference between our models to the comparable models in this domain is considering the temporal changes in the children s health patterns The major limitation of existing obesity models is twofold First available obesity models focus on single or only a few future point prediction for overweight or obese prediction such as San torelli et al 8 at age 2 We ng et al 9 at age 3 Red sell et al 10 at age 5 Levine et al 11 at age 5 and stratified by sex Robson et al 12 at age 5 Hammond et al 13 at age 5 D rue t et al 14 at age 7 and 14 St eur et al 15 at age 8 Man ios et al 16 17 at age 9 and 13 Pei et al 18 at age 10 and Gravers en et al 19 at adolescence These single point prediction models cannot be generalized to predict the future BMI trajectories starting from various points in early childhood and adolescence Obesity is prevalent in all age groups in childhood and adolescence This makes the application of these models limited as they cannot assist in predicting obesity status in other ages The second limitation about existing models relates to using aggregated patterns instead of longitudinal patterns for developing the models 20 For obesity this is a major limitation since rigorous research has shown that longitudinal patterns of obesity related measures such as body weight have a strong correlation with the future obesity patterns 21 Similarly a large body of research has shown that childhood obesity patterns are sensitive to different patterns of weight gain such that a more acute and rapid weight gain predicts a different severity of obesity versus a more gradual weight gain 21 Aggregating E HR datasets e g by calculating the average values loses valuable knowledge from this type of datasets having time series nature The presented models in this work follow a recurrent neural network RNN architecture with long short term memory LSTM cells and can learn a patient s representation from the temporal data collected over various visits of the patient Additionally as one of the major drawbacks of deep learning models like RNNs is the lack of interpret ability we use embedding weights on the input layer and soft max activation s on LSTM layers of our networks to calculate the importance of the features and attention weights for each input timestamp The importance score for the features and attention weights for time stamps are then used for visualizing different rankings Apart from the temporal components E HR data also contains static elements that do not change with every visit such as sex race ethnicity and zip code for each patient We used a separate feed forward network for the static data and merged its output with main architecture,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Machine learning methods have recently achieved high-performance in biomedical text analysis. However, a major bottleneck in the widespread application of these methods is obtaining the required large amounts of annotated training data, which is resource intensive and time consuming. Recent progress in self-supervised learning has shown promise in leveraging large text corpora without explicit annotations. In this work, we built a self-supervised contextual language representation model using BERT, a deep bidirectional transformer architecture, to identify radiology reports requiring prompt communication to the referring physicians. We pre-trained the BERT model on a large unlabeled corpus of radiology reports and used the resulting contextual representations in a final text classifier for communication urgency. Our model achieved a precision of 97.0%, recall of 93.3%, and F-measure of 95.1% on an independent test set in identifying radiology reports for prompt communication, and significantly outperformed the previous state-of-the-art model based on word2vec representations.",We used the held out DH MC evaluation data set to compare the performance of the BERT contextual word representations to the word 2 vec model as our baseline approach for predicting communication urgency based on radiology reports In this evaluation we measured standard classification evaluation metrics of precision recall and F measure to quantify the quality of the classification results In addition 95 confidence intervals were calculated for these metrics using the boots trapping approach These confidence intervals indicate the statistical power of these measures given the data set size in this study For boots trapping 28 we randomly selected n samples with replacement from the evaluation data set where n is the half of the size of the original evaluation data set We ran the boots trapping for 1 000 iterations and calculated the average precision recall and the F measure and their 95 confidence intervals as shown in Table 3 Table 3 Performance metrics and their 95 confidence intervals C Is based on 1 000 iterations boots trapping on the held out evaluation data set Model Precision Recall F measure Word 2

large corpus of radiology reports to identify cases for prompt communication to the referring physicians We employed the same training strategy as the BERT model s to build a class i fier based on word 2 vec semantic representations To maintain its consistency with our BERT model we used the same training development evaluation data set splits for training hyper parameter tuning and evaluation for the word 2 vec t model We compared the performance of the BERT model with the word 2 vec based class i fier which is the previous state of the art model for the identification of communication urgency based on radiology report texts Our evaluation showed that the BERT model achieved a precision of 97 0 recall of 93 3 and F measure of 95 1 for identifying cases for prompt communication outperforming the word 2 vec model which had a precision of 83 5 recall of 88 7 and F measure of 85 9 Of note the 95 confidence intervals of precision and F measure for BERT and the word 2 vec model do not overlap Therefore the BERT s gain for identification of communication urgency in our evaluation set over the word 2 vec based model based on these two metrics is statistically significant at the 0 05 level of significance We reviewed all the false positives and false negatives output ed by the BERT model in our evaluation set to conduct an error analysis for our proposed model Through this error analysis we observed common ali ties in our errors that once remedied can help to improve the performance of the BERT model in future work Most of the errors were caused due to the relatively long length of BERT input text from impression sections of the radiology reports in the evaluation set As mentioned in the previous section we treated the impression section of each radiology report as a single sequence of text as input to fine tune the BERT model Thus we treated the whole impression section as a single sequence consisting of multiple sub sentences Of note BERT in other classification applications such as the CoLA task was trained fine tuned on single sentences rather than a long sequence of multiple sentences The long length of the input sentences could have a negative impact on learning long distance dependencies in the resulting conte xu tal language model produced by the BERT model In future work we will investigate all ter native attention mecha s nim s and skip connections to adopt the BERT architecture for longer input sequences In addition we plan to make our input text more concise by eliminate less rel vent sentence for our task For example we could leverage clinical text processing tools such as Ne g Ex 29 to eliminate normal and negative findings in the radiology report impression sections to place more emphasis on critical findings for our urgency classification task and make the input shorter and more appr ori ate for the BERT model It is widely known that lapses in the communication of medical findings either due to delays or a lack of communication increase the likelihood of adverse patient outcomes 30 Particularly high workload and lack of administrative support in radiology settings present challenges in identifying and communicating cases that require urgent management on the part of the referring physician 24 Automatic methods that allow for accurate and rapid discrimination between cases requiring urgent communication and those that do not are highly beneficial In this study we developed a reliable and efficient model for identification of urgent cases that require prompt communication between a radiologist and a referring physician based on radiology reports We expect the proposed approach in this paper can significantly contribute to the development of clinical decision support systems to automatically find and flag cases that require communication with referring physicians based on free text radiology reports Our study has several limitations Although the BERT model outperformed the word 2 vec based model it did not outperform the word 2 vec model with statistical significance on the recall metric In addition our evaluation data set was from a single institution i e DH MC As future work we plan to extend our evaluation to a larger data set from multiple institutions to further investigate the performance of our contextual language model in analyzing radiology reports and to grasp its general iz ability Also our proposed classification model in this work for the identification of urgency in radiology reporting only relies on the patients ' radiology reports In future work we plan to incorporate additional related clinical information from electronic medical records to improve the accuracy of our model in assisting radiologists in detecting cases that require immediate attention by referring physicians As future work we also plan to extend the BERT language model beyond radiology reports by pre training BERT on other available large medical corpora We also plan to apply the resulting contextual word embedding s in different biomedical applications Particular y we aim to utilize BERT pre trained word embedding s in a multi task learning framework to extract various clinically significant elements of information from biomedical text Finally our team will pursue implementation of the proposed approach as part of a clinical decision support system in PAC S to facilitate the prompt communication of urgent findings between radiologists and referring physicians Conclusion In this paper we built a BERT contextual language model on a large corpus of radiology reports to identify radiology reports requiring prompt communication with the referring physicians We compared the performance of BERT with the state of the art word 2 vec model as the baseline approach In our experiment we used the same training and fine tuning strategies to build two class if i ers based on BERT and word 2 vec word embedding s for classification of communication urgency Evaluation of the two models on our 425 radiology report evaluation data set showed that the BERT model significantly outperformed the word 2 vec model on precision and F measure The clinical implementation of our proposed method could help improve patient outcomes by eliminating some cases of human error and expediting communication of urgent findings in radiology reports Acknowledgments

"The concrete efficiency of secure computation has been the focus of many recent works. In this work, we present concretely-efficient protocols for secure $3$-party computation (3PC) over a ring of integers modulo $2^{\ell}$ tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious security. Owing to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late. Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most efficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our protocol requires communication of $2$ ring elements per multiplication gate during the {\it online} phase, attaining a per-party cost of {\em less than one element}. This is achieved for the first time in the regime of 3PC. In the {\it malicious} setting, our protocol requires communication of $4$ elements per multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art protocol by $5$ elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective abort and fairness, the malicious protocol with fairness involves slightly more communication than its counterpart with abort security for the output gates {\em alone}. We apply our techniques from $3$PC in the regime of secure server-aided machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions-- linear regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM classification. Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model parameters and a client with a query, with the latter willing to learn the prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former.

"This work presents Origami, which provides privacy-preserving inference for large deep neural network (DNN) models through a combination of enclave execution, cryptographic blinding, interspersed with accelerator-based computation. Origami partitions the ML model into multiple partitions. The first partition receives the encrypted user input within an SGX enclave. The enclave decrypts the input and then applies cryptographic blinding to the input data and the model parameters. Cryptographic blinding is a technique that adds noise to obfuscate data. Origami sends the obfuscated data for computation to an untrusted GPU/CPU. The blinding and de-blinding factors are kept private by the SGX enclave, thereby preventing any adversary from denoising the data, when the computation is offloaded to a GPU/CPU. The computed output is returned to the enclave, which decodes the computation on noisy data using the unblinding factors privately stored within SGX. This process may be repeated for each DNN layer, as has been done in prior work Slalom. However, the overhead of blinding and unblinding the data is a limiting factor to scalability. Origami relies on the empirical observation that the feature maps after the first several layers can not be used, even by a powerful conditional GAN adversary to reconstruct input. Hence, Origami dynamically switches to executing the rest of the DNN layers directly on an accelerator without needing any further cryptographic blinding intervention to preserve privacy. We empirically demonstrate that using Origami, a conditional GAN adversary, even with an unlimited inference budget, cannot reconstruct the input. We implement and demonstrate the performance gains of Origami using the VGG-16 and VGG-19 models. Compared to running the entire VGG-19 model within SGX, Origami inference improves the performance of private inference from 11x while using Slalom to 15.1x.",of its computation on the noisy data back to the S GX enclave Because the GPU is performing only linear operations matrix multiplications in particular one can decode GPU results by subtracting the pre computed noisy components For this purpose the Slalom uses the privately stored un blinding factors to extract the computation result sans noise before applying non linear functions within the enclave Slalom s reliance on de cod ability of computed data requires the approach to run only linear operations on Fig 2 Comparison of run times GPU while requiring S GX to perform all non linear oper at ions Non linear operations on noisy data will essentially render the result sun de cod able Thus Slalom must pay the cost performance there is still a significant penalty that must be paid of blinding and un blinding every layer within a CNN model for private inference We analyzed the performance of Slalom compared to an execution without any privacy GPU As we show in our result C Key Idea 2 Reducing S GX execution further with Slalom section see Figure 12 the performance of Slalom is about While model partitioning reduces the amount of computing 10 x slower Hence even though Slalom offload s most of its done within S GX there is still a significant opportunity to computations to a GPU it still pays non trivial overheads lower the overheads Slalom 33 proposed an approach to We analyzed the reasons for this slowdown Our experiments enable compute intensive operations to be off loaded to a GPU showed that un blinding or blinding 6 MB features roughly from S GX while still preserving privacy Each layer of the takes 4 milliseconds and there are roughly 47 MB and 51 MB D NN is split partially between GPU and S GX enclave The intermediates features to process per each inference in VGG compute intensive convolutions matrix multiplications within,"[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Allowing machines to choose whether to kill humans would be devastating for world peace and security. But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about ""right"" and ""wrong"" conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass? In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.",were computed with the M CM ver attack mishandle bloody de human is e exculpate

"Unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is an open problem in machine learning. The Disentanglement-PyTorch library is developed to facilitate research, implementation, and testing of new variational algorithms. In this modular library, neural architectures, dimensionality of the latent space, and the training algorithms are fully decoupled, allowing for independent and consistent experiments across variational methods. The library handles the training scheduling, logging, and visualizations of reconstructions and latent space traversals. It also evaluates the encodings based on various disentanglement metrics. The library, so far, includes implementations of the following unsupervised algorithms VAE, Beta-VAE, Factor-VAE, DIP-I-VAE, DIP-II-VAE, Info-VAE, and Beta-TCVAE, as well as conditional approaches such as CVAE and IFCVAE.

"Machine learning techniques help to understand patterns of a dataset to create a defense mechanism against cyber attacks.

"Double descent refers to the phase transition that is exhibited by the generalization error of unregularized learning models when varying the ratio between the number of parameters and the number of training samples. The recent success of highly over-parameterized machine learning models such as deep neural networks has motivated a theoretical analysis of the double descent phenomenon in classical models such as linear regression which can also generalize well in the over-parameterized regime. We provide the first exact non-asymptotic expressions for double descent of the minimum norm linear estimator. Our approach involves constructing a special determinantal point process which we call surrogate random design, to replace the standard i.i.d. design of the training sample. This surrogate design admits exact expressions for the mean squared error of the estimator while preserving the key properties of the standard design. We also establish an exact implicit regularization result for over-parameterized training samples. In particular, we show that, for the surrogate design, the implicit bias of the unregularized minimum norm estimator precisely corresponds to solving a ridge-regularized least squares problem on the population distribution. In our analysis we introduce a new mathematical tool of independent interest: the class of random matrices for which determinant commutes with expectation.",we are able to provide precise formulas for the implicit regular iz ation induced by minimum norm solutions of under determined training samples relating it to classical ridge regular iz ation see Theorem 2 To obtain our precise results we use a somewhat non standard random design based on a specially chosen determinant al point process DPP which we term surrogate random design DPP s are a family of non i i d sampling distributions which are typically used to induce diversity in the produced samples Ku les za and T askar 2012 Our aim in using a DPP as a surrogate design is very different namely to make cer tain quantities such as the MSE analytically tractable while accurately preserving the underlying properties of the original data distribution This strategy might seem counter intuitive since DPP s are typically found most useful when they differ from the data distribution However we show both theoretically Theorem 3 and empirically Section 5 that for many commonly studied data distributions such as multivariate Gaussian s our DPP based surrogate design accurately preserves the key properties of the standard i i d design such as the MSE and even matches it exactly in the high dimensional asymptotic limit In our analysis of the surrogate design we introduce the concept of determinant preserving random matrices Section 4 a class of random matrices for which determinant commutes with expectation which should be of independent interest 1 1 Main results double descent and implicit regular iz ation As the per fo rm ance me t ric in our analysis we use the mean squared error MSE defined as M SEr wp s E wp w 2 where w is a fixed underlying linear model of the responses In analyzing the MSE we make the following standard assumption that the response noise is homos ced a stic Assumption 1 Homos ced a stic noise The noise y px q xJ w has mean 0 and variance 2,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

First of all, the dimension of these datasets has been reduced to fifty percent of their original dimension by selecting and extracting the most relevant and appropriate features or attributes using Deep Autoencoder and NCA dimensionality reduction techniques. Afterward, each dataset is classified applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Extended Nearest Neighbors (ENN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms. All classification algorithms are developed in the Matlab environment. In each classification, the training test data ratio is always set to ninety percent: ten percent.

"One of the principal tasks of machine learning with major applications is text classification. This paper focuses on the legal domain and, in particular, on the classification of lengthy legal documents. The main challenge that this study addresses is the limitation that current models impose on the length of the input text. In addition, the present paper shows that dividing the text into segments and later combining the resulting embeddings with a BiLSTM architecture to form a single document embedding can improve results. These advancements are achieved by utilising a simpler structure, rather than an increasingly complex one, which is often the case in NLP research.

"The complexity of human cancer often results in significant heterogeneity in response to treatment. Precision medicine offers potential to improve patient outcomes by leveraging this heterogeneity. Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) formalize precision medicine as maps from the patient covariate space into the space of allowable treatments. The optimal ITR is that which maximizes the mean of a clinical outcome in a population of interest. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) studies permit the evaluation of multiple treatments within a single tumor and thus are ideally suited for estimating optimal ITRs. PDX data are characterized by correlated outcomes, a high-dimensional feature space, and a large number of treatments. Existing methods for estimating optimal ITRs do not take advantage of the unique structure of PDX data or handle the associated challenges well. In this paper, we explore machine learning methods for estimating optimal ITRs from PDX data. We analyze data from a large PDX study to identify biomarkers that are informative for developing personalized treatment recommendations in multiple cancers. We estimate optimal ITRs using regression-based approaches such as Q-learning and direct search methods such as outcome weighted learning. Finally, we implement a superlearner approach to combine a set of estimated ITRs and show that the resulting ITR performs better than any of the input ITRs, mitigating uncertainty regarding user choice of any particular ITR estimation methodology. Our results indicate that PDX data are a valuable resource for developing individualized treatment strategies in oncology.",in significant heterogeneity in response to treatment Precision medicine offers potential to improve patient outcomes by leveraging this heterogeneity Individualized treatment rules IT Rs formalize precision medicine as maps from the patient co variate space into the space of allowable treatments The optimal IT R is that which maximizes the mean of a clinical outcome in a population of interest Patient derived xe no graft PD X studies permit the evaluation of multiple treatments within a single tumor and thus are ideally suited for estimating optimal IT Rs PD X data are characterized by correlated outcomes a high dimensional feature space and a large number of treatments Existing methods for estimating optimal IT Rs do not take advantage of the unique structure of PD X data or handle the associated challenges well In this paper we explore machine learning methods for estimating optimal IT Rs from PD X data We analyze data from a large PD X study to identify biomarkers that are informative for de v eloping personalized treatment recommendations in multiple cancers We estimate optimal IT Rs using regression based approaches such as Q-Learning and direct search methods such as outcome weighted learning Finally we implement a super learner approach to combine a set of estimated IT Rs and show that the resulting IT R performs better than any of the input IT Rs mitigating uncertainty regarding user choice of any particular IT R estimation methodology Our results in dic ate that PD X data are a valuable resource for developing individualized treatment strategies in oncology Keywords Biomarkers Deep learning auto encoders Machine learning Outcome weighted learn ing Precision medicine Patient derived xe no grafts Q-Learning,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Research has shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be effectively applied to text classification as part of a predictive coding protocol. That said, most research to date has been conducted on data sets with short documents that do not reflect the variety of documents in real world document reviews. Using data from four actual reviews with documents of varying lengths, we compared CNN with other popular machine learning algorithms for text classification, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. For each data set, classification models were trained with different training sample sizes using different learning algorithms. These models were then evaluated using a large randomly sampled test set of documents, and the results were compared using precision and recall curves. Our study demonstrates that CNN performed well, but that there was no single algorithm that performed the best across the combination of data sets and training sample sizes.

"Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) has been widely applied as a fundamental generative model in machine learning. For complex samples like imagery objects or scenes, however, VAE suffers from the dimensional dilemma between reconstruction precision that needs high-dimensional latent codes and probabilistic inference that favors a low-dimensional latent space. By virtue of high-dimensional geometry, we propose a very simple algorithm, called Spherical Auto-Encoder (SAE), completely different from existing VAEs to address the issue. SAE is in essence the vanilla autoencoder with spherical normalization on the latent space. We analyze the unique characteristics of random variables on spheres in high dimensions and argue that random variables on spheres are agnostic to various prior distributions and data modes when the dimension is sufficiently high. Therefore, SAE can harness a high-dimensional latent space to improve the inference precision of latent codes while maintain the property of stochastic sampling from priors. The experiments on sampling and inference validate our theoretical analysis and the superiority of SAE.",to test our theory and al go rit hms in this section Three aspects pertaining to genera ti ve

"Automatic neural architecture search techniques are becoming increasingly important in machine learning area. Especially, weight sharing methods have shown remarkable potentials on searching good network architectures with few computational resources. However, existing weight sharing methods mainly suffer limitations on searching strategies: these methods either uniformly train all network paths to convergence which introduces conflicts between branches and wastes a large amount of computation on unpromising candidates, or selectively train branches with different frequency which leads to unfair evaluation and comparison among paths. To address these issues, we propose a novel neural architecture search method with balanced training strategy to ensure fair comparisons and a selective drop mechanism to reduce conflicts among candidate paths.

"A crucial factor to trust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm decisions is a good representation of its application field by the training dataset. This is particularly true when parts of the training data have been artificially generated to overcome common training problems such as lack of data or imbalanced dataset. Over the last few years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable results in generating realistic data. However, this ML approach lacks an objective function to evaluate the quality of the generated data. Numerous GAN applications focus on generating image data mostly because they can be easily evaluated by a human eye. Less efforts have been made to generate time series data. Assessing their quality is more complicated, particularly for technical data. In this paper, we propose a human-centered approach supporting a ML or domain expert to accomplish this task using Visual Analytics (VA) techniques. The presented approach consists of two views, namely a GAN Iteration View showing similarity metrics between real and generated data over the iterations of the generation process and a Detailed Comparative View equipped with different time series visualizations such as TimeHistograms, to compare the generated data at different iteration steps. Starting from the GAN Iteration View, the user can choose suitable iteration steps for detailed inspection.

"This paper studies how to forecast daily closing price series of Bitcoin, using data on prices and volumes of prior days. Bitcoin price behaviour is still largely unexplored, presenting new opportunities. We compared our results with two modern works on Bitcoin prices forecasting and with a well-known recent paper that uses Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily NASDAQ closing prices spanning a 3-year interval. We followed different approaches in parallel, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. The SLR model for univariate series forecast uses only closing prices, whereas the MLR model for multivariate series uses both price and volume data. We applied the ADF -Test to these series, which resulted to be indistinguishable from a random walk. We also used two artificial neural networks: MLP and LSTM. We then partitioned the dataset into shorter sequences, representing different price regimes, obtaining best result using more than one previous price, thus confirming our regime hypothesis. All the models were evaluated in terms of MAPE and relativeRMSE. They performed well, and were overall better than those obtained in the benchmarks.

"Classifiers trained with class-imbalanced data are known to perform poorly on test data of the ""minor"" classes, of which we have insufficient training data. In this paper, we investigate learning a ConvNet classifier under such a scenario. We found that a ConvNet significantly over-fits the minor classes, which is quite opposite to traditional machine learning algorithms that often under-fit minor classes. We conducted a series of analysis and discovered the feature deviation phenomenon -- the learned ConvNet generates deviated features between the training and test data of minor classes -- which explains how over-fitting happens. To compensate for the effect of feature deviation which pushes test data toward low decision value regions, we propose to incorporate class-dependent temperatures (CDT) in training a ConvNet.

"This paper investigates trajectory prediction for robotics, to improve the interaction of robots with moving targets, such as catching a bouncing ball. Unexpected, highly-non-linear trajectories cannot easily be predicted with regression-based fitting procedures, therefore we apply state of the art machine learning, specifically based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. In addition, fast moving targets are better sensed using event cameras, which produce an asynchronous output triggered by spatial change, rather than at fixed temporal intervals as with traditional cameras. We investigate how LSTM models can be adapted for event camera data, and in particular look at the benefit of using asynchronously sampled data.",in several fields like Natural Language Processing 17 18 19 since it can map input sequences to output ones with different length An Encoder Decoder network has been combined also with a beam search algorithm for predicting vehicle trajectories 20 for self driving cars In this paper we investigate the integration of event data with the LSTM architecture for learning to predict the trajectory of a bouncing ball focusing on the effect of different sampling strategies when combined with the Fig 2 Spatial and temporal error component of the learning architecture fixed rate sampling as performed in sequence to sequence error for a pair of prediction and traditional cameras compared with spatial sampling as is ground truth associated with event cameras Experiments are performed using the neuro m orphic i Cub robot 21 equipped with the AT IS 4 event camera The ball bounces on a table in front of noise that could occur if the visual data is directly fed of the robot and the robot using the observed past ball into the learning system and focus on the effect of sampling positions predicts the future trajectory for a given sequence strategies on the prediction In this work we implement a,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"We consider the problem of training machine learning models over multi-relational data. The mainstream approach is to first construct the training dataset using a feature extraction query over input database and then use a statistical software package of choice to train the model. In this paper we introduce Iterative Functional Aggregate Queries (IFAQ), a framework that realizes an alternative approach. IFAQ treats the feature extraction query and the learning task as one program given in the IFAQ's domain-specific language, which captures a subset of Python commonly used in Jupyter notebooks for rapid prototyping of machine learning applications. The program is subject to several layers of IFAQ optimizations, such as algebraic transformations, loop transformations, schema specialization, data layout optimizations, and finally compilation into efficient low-level C++ code specialized for the given workload and data. We show that a Scala implementation of IFAQ can outperform mlpack, Scikit, and TensorFlow by several orders of magnitude for linear regression and regression tree models over several relational datasets.",One explanation is that compute the average of four subsequent runs We do not ml pack copies the input data to compute its transpose In our consider the time to load the database into RAM and assume experiments ml pack failed for as little as 5 of the Favor it a that all relations are indexed by their join attributes training data set 100 MB on disk We learn the models over all continuous attributes for Benchmarking End To End Learning Figure 5 shows Favor it a and Retailer We learn regression trees up to depth the results of the end to end benchmarks for learning linear four i e max 31 nodes regression and regression tree models in I FAQ sci kit learn The input to I FAQ is a program that performs batch gradi and Tensor Flow The runtime for the latter two is the sum ent descent optimization for Linear Regression models or the of two components depicted in Figure 6 by two bars 1 CART algorithm for learning regression trees I FAQ auto mat the left bar is the time to materialize the project join query ic ally optimizes the code For Linear Regression it employs the that defines the training data set 2 the right bar is the time full suite of optimization s including the memo iz ation and to learn the model I FAQ learns the model directly over the hoisting of the co var matrix For regression trees the ag gre input database in one computation step gates cannot be hoisted but they still benefit from the lower level optimization s including loop fusion and data layout,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Autoencoders are a common building block of Deep Learning architectures, where they are mainly used for representation learning. They have also been successfully used in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems to predict missing ratings. Unfortunately, like all black box machine learning models, they are unable to explain their outputs. Hence, while predictions from an Autoencoder-based recommender system might be accurate, it might not be clear to the user why a recommendation was generated. In this work, we design an explainable recommendation system using an Autoencoder model whose predictions can be explained using the neighborhood based explanation style.

"Most generative models of audio directly generate samples in one of two domains: time or frequency. While sufficient to express any signal, these representations are inefficient, as they do not utilize existing knowledge of how sound is generated and perceived. A third approach (vocoders/synthesizers) successfully incorporates strong domain knowledge of signal processing and perception, but has been less actively researched due to limited expressivity and difficulty integrating with modern auto-differentiation-based machine learning methods. In this paper, we introduce the Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) library, which enables direct integration of classic signal processing elements with deep learning methods. Focusing on audio synthesis, we achieve high-fidelity generation without the need for large autoregressive models or adversarial losses, demonstrating that DDSP enables utilizing strong inductive biases without losing the expressive power of neural networks. Further, we show that combining interpretable modules permits manipulation of each separate model component, with applications such as independent control of pitch and loudness, realistic extrapolation to pitches not seen during training, blind dereverberation of room acoustics, transfer of extracted room acoustics to new environments, and transformation of timbre between disparate sources. In short, DDSP enables an interpretable and modular approach to generative modeling, without sacrificing the benefits of deep learning.

"Accurate and reliable forecasting of total cloud cover (TCC) is vital for many areas such as astronomy, energy demand and production, or agriculture. Most meteorological centres issue ensemble forecasts of TCC, however, these forecasts are often uncalibrated and exhibit worse forecast skill than ensemble forecasts of other weather variables. Hence, some form of post-processing is strongly required to improve predictive performance. As TCC observations are usually reported on a discrete scale taking just nine different values called oktas, statistical calibration of TCC ensemble forecasts can be considered a classification problem with outputs given by the probabilities of the oktas. This is a classical area where machine learning methods are applied. We investigate the performance of post-processing using multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random forest (RF) methods. Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global TCC ensemble forecasts for 2002-2014 we compare these approaches with the proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) and multiclass logistic regression (MLR) models, as well as the raw TCC ensemble forecasts. We further assess whether improvements in forecast skill can be obtained by incorporating ensemble forecasts of precipitation as additional predictor. Compared to the raw ensemble, all calibration methods result in a significant improvement in forecast skill. RF models provide the smallest increase in predictive performance, while MLP, POLR and GBM approaches perform best. The use of precipitation forecast data leads to further improvements in forecast skill and except for very short lead times the extended MLP model shows the best overall performance.",All calibration approaches presented in Section 3 require training data which should be large enough to provide numerical stability and reasonable predictive performance Following He mri et al 2014 we here focus on local calibration i e post processing of forecasts for a given station is performed using only training data of that particular station Therefore relatively long training periods are required to achieve a suitably large training set In order to ensure comparability with the reference approaches we consider 5 year training periods and both non seasonal and seasonal training schemes as in He mri et al 2016 In the non seasonal training forecasts and observations of 5 calendar years e g 1 January 2003 31 December 2007 are used to train the model for calibration of T CC Ensemble forecasts for the whole next calendar year 1 January 31 December 2008 then the training period is rolled ahead by one year 1 January 2004 31 December 2008 In the seasonal approach two different seasons are considered covering April September and October March and T CC Ensemble forecast for a given day is calibrated using training data from the same season only The use of 5 year training periods means that predictive P MFs are available for the time interval between 1 January 2007 and 20 March 2014 2636 calendar days where one can test the forecast skill of the post processing methods presented in Section 3 Further as suggested by He mri et al 2016 numerical problems with LogS calculation,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Most machine learning methods require careful selection of hyper-parameters in order to train a high performing model with good generalization abilities. Hence, several automatic selection algorithms have been introduced to overcome tedious manual (try and error) tuning of these parameters. Due to its very high sample efficiency, Bayesian Optimization over a Gaussian Processes modeling of the parameter space has become the method of choice. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from a cubic compute complexity due to underlying Cholesky factorization, which makes it very hard to be scaled beyond a small number of sampling steps. In this paper, we present a novel, highly accurate approximation of the underlying Gaussian Process. Reducing its computational complexity from cubic to quadratic allows an efficient strong scaling of Bayesian Optimization while outperforming the previous approach regarding optimization accuracy.

"Background subtraction is a fundamental pre-processing task in computer vision. This task becomes challenging in real scenarios due to variations in the background for both static and moving camera sequences. Several deep learning methods for background subtraction have been proposed in the literature with competitive performances. However, these models show performance degradation when tested on unseen videos; and they require huge amount of data to avoid overfitting. Recently, graph-based algorithms have been successful approaching unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems. Furthermore, the theory of graph signal processing and semi-supervised learning have been combined leading to new insights in the field of machine learning. In this paper, concepts of recovery of graph signals are introduced in the problem of background subtraction. We propose a new algorithm called Graph BackGround Subtraction (GraphBGS), which is composed of: instance segmentation, background initialization, graph construction, graph sampling, and a semi-supervised algorithm inspired from the theory of recovery of graph signals.

"Monitoring the magnet temperature in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) for automotive applications is a challenging task for several decades now, as signal injection or sensor-based methods still prove unfeasible in a commercial context. Overheating results in severe motor deterioration and is thus of high concern for the machine's control strategy and its design. Lack of precise temperature estimations leads to lesser device utilization and higher material cost. In this work, several machine learning (ML) models are empirically evaluated on their estimation accuracy for the task of predicting latent high-dynamic magnet temperature profiles. The range of selected algorithms covers as diverse approaches as possible with ordinary and weighted least squares, support vector regression, $k$-nearest neighbors, randomized trees and neural networks.

"The goal of this paper is to use all available Polish language data sets to seek the best possible performance in supervised sentiment analysis of short texts. We use text collections with labelled sentiment such as tweets, movie reviews and a sentiment treebank, in three comparison modes. In the first, we examine the performance of models trained and tested on the same text collection using standard cross-validation (in-domain). In the second we train models on all available data except the given test collection, which we use for testing (one vs rest cross-domain). In the third, we train a model on one data set and apply it to another one (one vs one cross-domain). We compare wide range of methods including machine learning on bag-of-words representation, bidirectional recurrent neural networks as well as the most recent pre-trained architectures ELMO and BERT. We formulate conclusions as to cross-domain and in-domain performance of each method. Unsurprisingly, BERT turned out to be a strong performer, especially in the cross-domain setting.

While practitioners celebrate synthetic data generation using GANs as an economical way to augment data for training data-hungry machine learning models, it is unclear whether they recognize the perils of such techniques when applied to real world datasets biased along latent dimensions. Specifically, we show that (1) traditional GANs further skew the distribution of a dataset consisting of engineering faculty headshots, generating minority modes less often and of worse quality and (2) image-to-image translation (conditional) GANs also exacerbate biases by lightening skin color of non-white faces and transforming female facial features to be masculine when generating faces of engineering professors.

"Much of machine learning relies on the use of large amounts of data to train models to make predictions. When this data comes from multiple sources, for example when evaluation of data against a machine learning model is offered as a service, there can be privacy issues and legal concerns over the sharing of data. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows data to be computed on whilst encrypted, which can provide a solution to the problem of data privacy. However, FHE is both slow and restrictive, so existing algorithms must be manipulated to make them work efficiently under the FHE paradigm. Some commonly used machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian process regression, are poorly suited to FHE and cannot be manipulated to work both efficiently and accurately. In this paper, we show that a modular approach, which applies FHE to only the sensitive steps of a workflow that need protection, allows one party to make predictions on their data using a Gaussian process regression model built from another party's data, without either party gaining access to the other's data, in a way which is both accurate and efficient.

"The transparent cornea is the window of the eye, facilitating the entry of light rays and controlling focusing the movement of the light within the eye. The cornea is critical, contributing to 75% of the refractive power of the eye. Keratoconus is a progressive and multifactorial corneal degenerative disease affecting 1 in 2000 individuals worldwide. Currently, there is no cure for keratoconus other than corneal transplantation for advanced stage keratoconus or corneal cross-linking, which can only halt KC progression. The ability to accurately identify subtle KC or KC progression is of vital clinical significance. To date, there has been little consensus on a useful model to classify KC patients, which therefore inhibits the ability to predict disease progression accurately. In this paper, we utilised machine learning to analyse data from 124 KC patients, including topographical and clinical variables. Both supervised multilayer perceptron and unsupervised variational autoencoder models were used to classify KC patients with reference to the existing Amsler-Krumeich (A-K) classification system. Both methods result in high accuracy, with the unsupervised method showing better performance. The result showed that the unsupervised method with a selection of 29 variables could be a powerful tool to provide an automatic classification tool for clinicians.

"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have evolved as popular machine learning models for image classification during the past few years, due to their ability to learn the problem-specific features directly from the input images. The success of deep learning models solicits architecture engineering rather than hand-engineering the features. However, designing state-of-the-art CNN for a given task remains a non-trivial and challenging task, especially when training data size is less. To address this phenomena, transfer learning has been used as a popularly adopted technique. While transferring the learned knowledge from one task to another, fine-tuning with the target-dependent Fully Connected (FC) layers generally produces better results over the target task. In this paper, the proposed AutoFCL model attempts to learn the structure of FC layers of a CNN automatically using Bayesian optimization. To evaluate the performance of the proposed AutoFCL, we utilize five pre-trained CNN models such as VGG-16, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and NASNetMobile. The experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely CalTech-101, Oxford-102 Flowers, and UC Merced Land Use datasets. Fine-tuning the newly learned (target-dependent) FC layers leads to state-of-the-art performance, according to the experiments carried out in this research. The proposed AutoFCL method outperforms the existing methods over CalTech-101 and Oxford-102 Flowers datasets by achieving the accuracy of 94.38% and 98.89%, respectively.

"Statistical (machine learning) tools for equation discovery require large amounts of data that are typically computer generated rather than experimentally observed. Multiscale modeling and stochastic simulations are two areas where learning on simulated data can lead to such discovery. In both, the data are generated with a reliable but impractical model, e.g., molecular dynamics simulations, while a model on the scale of interest is uncertain, requiring phenomenological constitutive relations and ad-hoc approximations. We replace the human discovery of such models, which typically involves spatial/stochastic averaging or coarse-graining, with a machine-learning strategy based on sparse regression that can be executed in two modes. The first, direct equation-learning, discovers a differential operator from the whole dictionary. The second, constrained equation-learning, discovers only those terms in the differential operator that need to be discovered, i.e., learns closure approximations. We illustrate our approach by learning a deterministic equation that governs the spatiotemporal evolution of the probability density function of a system state whose dynamics are described by a nonlinear partial differential equation with random inputs. A series of examples demonstrates the accuracy, robustness, and limitations of our approach to equation discovery.",when the optimal solution is in the vicinity of the hypothesis class but might differ significantly when the solution is far from optimal In general the choice of the algorithm depends on whether one favors more sparsity or accuracy For N realization s of the random inputs 1 is solved N times on the disc ret i zed space time MC MC domain D 0 T yielding N solutions u x t These Monte Carlo results are then post processed MC e g with a Gaussian kernel density estimator KDE used in this study to obtain the single point PDF f U x t on the disc ret i zed domain D D 0 T The KDE bandwidth is estimated for every grid u u point in D 0 T using Scott s normal reference rule h 3 49 N 1 3 26 where is the standard MC deviation of the data The effect of the bandwidth on the solution is discussed in appendix Appendix D Both the kernel type and the bandwidth are added hyper parameters that can be optimized The matrices and in 13 can be very large depending on the selected order of the polynomials,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Data-driven approaches, most prominently deep learning, have become powerful tools for prediction in many domains. A natural question to ask is whether data-driven methods could also be used to predict global weather patterns days in advance. First studies show promise but the lack of a common dataset and evaluation metrics make inter-comparison between studies difficult. Here we present a benchmark dataset for data-driven medium-range weather forecasting, a topic of high scientific interest for atmospheric and computer scientists alike. We provide data derived from the ERA5 archive that has been processed to facilitate the use in machine learning models. We propose simple and clear evaluation metrics which will enable a direct comparison between different methods. Further, we provide baseline scores from simple linear regression techniques, deep learning models, as well as purely physical forecasting models. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench and the companion code is reproducible with tutorials for getting started.

"Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform (SRHT), a popular random projection method that can efficiently project a $d$-dimensional data into $r$-dimensional space ($r \ll d$) in $O(dlog(d))$ time, has been widely used to address the challenge of high-dimensionality in machine learning. SRHT works by rotating the input data matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ by Randomized Walsh-Hadamard Transform followed with a subsequent uniform column sampling on the rotated matrix. Despite the advantages of SRHT, one limitation of SRHT is that it generates the new low-dimensional embedding without considering any specific properties of a given dataset. Therefore, this data-independent random projection method may result in inferior and unstable performance when used for a particular machine learning task, e.g., classification. To overcome this limitation, we analyze the effect of using SRHT for random projection in the context of linear SVM classification. Based on our analysis, we propose importance sampling and deterministic top-$r$ sampling to produce effective low-dimensional embedding instead of uniform sampling SRHT. In addition, we also proposed a new supervised non-uniform sampling method.

"People deploy top-down, goal-directed attention to accomplish tasks, such as finding lost keys. By tuning the visual system to relevant information sources, object recognition can become more efficient (a benefit) and more biased toward the target (a potential cost). Motivated by selective attention in categorisation models, we developed a goal-directed attention mechanism that can process naturalistic (photographic) stimuli. Our attention mechanism can be incorporated into any existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNNs). The processing stages in DCNNs have been related to ventral visual stream. In that light, our attentional mechanism incorporates top-down influences from prefrontal cortex (PFC) to support goal-directed behaviour. Akin to how attention weights in categorisation models warp representational spaces, we introduce a layer of attention weights to the mid-level of a DCNN that amplify or attenuate activity to further a goal. We evaluated the attentional mechanism using photographic stimuli, varying the attentional target. We found that increasing goal-directed attention has benefits (increasing hit rates) and costs (increasing false alarm rates). At a moderate level, attention improves sensitivity (i.e., increases $d^\prime$) at only a moderate increase in bias for tasks involving standard images, blended images, and natural adversarial images chosen to fool DCNNs.

"As neural networks are increasingly employed in machine learning practice, how to efficiently share limited training resources among a diverse set of model training tasks becomes a crucial issue. To achieve better utilization of the shared resources, we explore the idea of jointly training multiple neural network models on a single GPU in this paper. We realize this idea by proposing a primitive, called pack. We further present a comprehensive empirical study of pack and end-to-end experiments that suggest significant improvements for hyperparameter tuning. The results suggest: (1) packing two models can bring up to 40% performance improvement over unpacked setups for a single training step and the improvement increases when packing more models; (2) the benefit of the pack primitive largely depends on a number of factors including memory capacity, chip architecture, neural network structure, and batch size; (3) there exists a trade-off between packing and unpacking when training multiple neural network models on limited resources; (4) a pack-aware Hyperband is up to 2.7x faster than the original Hyperband, with this improvement growing as memory size increases and subsequently the density of models packed.",will be stored as batch size increases Similarly when packing two models the GPU memory usage is the sum of memory usage However the GPU memory usage peak of MLP 3 model maintains the same as the batch size goes up This is mainly due to two reasons 1 we find that for simple models Tensor Flow s greedy memory allocation policy over allocates more GPU s memory when the actual usage is lower than a specific threshold 2 the majority of computations forMLP 3 are dot products and a replaced on CPU by Tensor Flow and do not

We profile the switching overhead of two models to illustrate how much the overhead can accumulate as more models are trained the time pack can save As shown in the Table 1 albeit the accumulation the switching overhead using Eq 4 is minor compared to the overall training time and it is even negligible when more epochs are involved in a training process This also confirms our hypothesis of the

train the same models MLP Mobile Net ResNet DenseNet with the same optimizer and same batch size ranging from 32 to 100 Although CUDA supports it our results show that it is not an efficient technique

"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of mortality worldwide. Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the asymptomatic stage can help prevent strokes. It also improves clinical decision making through the delivery of suitable treatment such as, anticoagulant therapy, in a timely manner. The clinical significance of such early detection of AF in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has inspired numerous studies in recent years, of which many aim to solve this task by leveraging machine learning algorithms. ECG datasets containing AF samples, however, usually suffer from severe class imbalance, which if unaccounted for, affects the performance of classification algorithms. Data augmentation is a popular solution to tackle this problem. In this study, we investigate the impact of various data augmentation algorithms, e.g., oversampling, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), on solving the class imbalance problem. These algorithms are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated, compared and discussed in detail. The results show that deep learning-based AF signal classification methods benefit more from data augmentation using GANs and GMMs, than oversampling. Furthermore, the GAN results in circa $3\%$ better AF classification accuracy in average while performing comparably to the GMM in terms of f1-score.",In these approaches expert knowledge of cardiologists decision making through the delivery of suitable treatment such as was taken into account to calculate representative and distinctive anticoagulant therapy in a timely manner The clinical significance of such early detection of AF in electrocardiogram ECG signals features These works either focus on detecting the presence of has inspired numerous studies in recent years of which many aim the f wave instead of the P peak 9 or are based on anomaly to solve this task by leveraging machine learning algorithms ECG detection in the R R intervals in ECG signals 10 datasets containing AF samples however usually suffer from severe Hand crafting descriptors and engineering features however class imbalance which if un accounted for affects the performance of classification algorithms Data augmentation is a popular solution are very expensive time consuming and tedious Moreover they to tackle this problem demand the availability of expert knowledge Convolutional In this study we investigate the impact of various data aug Neural Networks CNN s provide the means to automate this ment ation algorithms e g oversampling Gaussian Mixture Models feature extraction process without the need for expert domain GM Ms and Generative Adversarial Networks GANs on solving knowledge Moreover the hierarchical data processing nature the class imbalance problem These algorithms are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated compared and discussed in detail The results of CNN s produces highly descriptive and informative features show that deep learning based AF signal classification methods Deep CNN s have shown competitive performance in different benefit more from data augmentation using GANs and GM Ms than computer vision and medical applications and in some cases oversampling Furthermore the GAN results in circa 3 better AF matched or even surpassed the human accuracy 11 classification accuracy in average while performing comparably to the G MM in terms off 1 score Deep CNN s have also been adopted for ECG signal cl as s if i cation Raj pur kar et al 12 proposed a 34 layer CNN for Keywords atrial fibrillation data augmentation G MM DCGAN classifying 12 cardiac disorders by mapping the ECG signals to their corresponding rhythmic disorder classes Andreotti et,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Accurate and efficient models for rainfall runoff (RR) simulations are crucial for flood risk management. Most rainfall models in use today are process-driven; i.e. they solve either simplified empirical formulas or some variation of the St. Venant (shallow water) equations. With the development of machine-learning techniques, we may now be able to emulate rainfall models using, for example, neural networks. In this study, a data-driven RR model using a sequence-to-sequence Long-short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network was constructed. The model was tested for a watershed in Houston, TX, known for severe flood events. The LSTM network's capability in learning long-term dependencies between the input and output of the network allowed modeling RR with high resolution in time (15 minutes). Using 10-years precipitation from 153 rainfall gages and river channel discharge data (more than 5.3 million data points), and by designing several numerical tests the developed model performance in predicting river discharge was tested. The model results were also compared with the output of a process-driven model Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA). Moreover, physical consistency of the LSTM model was explored. The model results showed that the LSTM model was able to efficiently predict discharge and achieve good model performance. When compared to GSSHA, the data-driven model was more efficient and robust in terms of prediction and calibration. Interestingly, the performance of the LSTM model improved (test Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency from 0.666 to 0.942) when a selected subset of rainfall gages based on the model performance, were used as input instead of all rainfall gages.",and discussion section will start by presenting the results from the developed LSTM model how well the model can predict runoff discharge using precipitation from each gage and how consistent the results were with physical intuition For this purpose the two numerical tests of experiment 1 will be discussed Next the performance of the constructed LSTM model with the 10 selected gages data as input will be investigated and the results will be compared with the model using all 153 gages data as input Finally the results of the GS SHA model developed for the Brays Bayou watershed will be presented and the difference between the predictions from GS SHA and LSTM will be discussed 4 1 Physical consistency of LSTM result The training errors of LSTM models using each single rainfall gage first numerical test in experiment 1 are shown in Figure 4 The lowest training error was 29 94 in a gage just upstream of the discharge gage and highest training error was 278 11 in a gage located outside of Harris County From Figure 4 it can be seen that gages with the best performance are the ones located within or near the watershed In fact the Pearson correlation between the training error extracted from the LSTM model and the physical distance between the rainfall gages and the USGS gage was significant with ap value of 3 5 E 31 andr 0 77 This results show that similar to the process driven model where precipitation drives runoff and the amount of precipitation falls into the watershed is represented by the interpolation of,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Overfitting and treatment of ""small data"" are among the most challenging problems in the machine learning (ML), when a relatively small data statistics size $T$ is not enough to provide a robust ML fit for a relatively large data feature dimension $D$. Deploying a massively-parallel ML analysis of generic classification problems for different $D$ and $T$, existence of statistically-significant linear overfitting barriers for common ML methods is demonstrated. For example, these results reveal that for a robust classification of bioinformatics-motivated generic problems with the Long Short-Term Memory deep learning classifier (LSTM) one needs in a best case a statistics $T$ that is at least 13.8 times larger then the feature dimension $D$. It is shown that this overfitting barrier can be breached at a $10^{-12}$ fraction of the computational cost by means of the entropy-optimal Scalable Probabilistic Approximations algorithm (eSPA), performing a joint solution of the entropy-optimal Bayesian network inference and feature space segmentation problems.

"Hundreds of millions of surgical procedures take place annually across the world, which generate a prevalent type of electronic health record (EHR) data comprising time series physiological signals. Here, we present a transferable embedding method (i.e., a method to transform time series signals into input features for predictive machine learning models) named PHASE (PHysiologicAl Signal Embeddings) that enables us to more accurately forecast adverse surgical outcomes based on physiological signals. We evaluate PHASE on minute-by-minute EHR data of more than 50,000 surgeries from two operating room (OR) datasets and patient stays in an intensive care unit (ICU) dataset.

In a transfer learning setting where we train embedding models in one dataset then embed signals and predict adverse events in unseen data, PHASE achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy at lower computational cost compared to conventional approaches.

"We extend the idea of word pieces in natural language models to machine learning tasks on opaque ids. This is achieved by applying hash functions to map each id to multiple hash tokens in a much smaller space, similarly to a Bloom filter. We show that by applying a multi-layer Transformer to these Bloom filter digests, we are able to obtain models with high accuracy. They outperform models of a similar size without hashing and, to a large degree, models of a much larger size trained using sampled softmax with the same computational budget. Our key observation is that it is important to use a multi-layer Transformer for Bloom filter digests to remove ambiguity in the hashed input.

"Adversarial training, a special case of multi-objective optimization, is an increasingly prevalent machine learning technique: some of its most notable applications include GAN-based generative modeling and self-play techniques in reinforcement learning which have been applied to complex games such as Go or Poker.

However, while a classic result in game theory states such an equilibrium exists in concave-convex games, there is no analogous guarantee if the payoff is nonconcave-nonconvex.

"Recent advances in machine learning have led to increased deployment of black-box classifiers across a wide variety of applications. In many such situations there is a critical need to both reliably assess the performance of these pre-trained models and to perform this assessment in a label-efficient manner (given that labels may be scarce and costly to collect). In this paper, we introduce an active Bayesian approach for assessment of classifier performance to satisfy the desiderata of both reliability and label-efficiency. We begin by developing inference strategies to quantify uncertainty for common assessment metrics such as accuracy, misclassification cost, and calibration error. We then propose a general framework for active Bayesian assessment using inferred uncertainty to guide efficient selection of instances for labeling, enabling better performance assessment with fewer labels. We demonstrate significant gains from our proposed active Bayesian approach via a series of systematic empirical experiments assessing the performance of modern neural classifiers (e.g., ResNet and

"Machine learning for data-driven diagnosis has been actively studied in medicine to provide better healthcare. Supporting analysis of a patient cohort similar to a patient under treatment is a key task for clinicians to make decisions with high confidence. However, such analysis is not straightforward due to the characteristics of medical records: high dimensionality, irregularity in time, and sparsity. To address this challenge, we introduce a method for similarity calculation of medical records. Our method employs event and sequence embeddings. While we use an autoencoder for the event embedding, we apply its variant with the self-attention mechanism for the sequence embedding. Moreover, in order to better handle the irregularity of data, we enhance the self-attention mechanism with consideration of different time intervals. We have developed a visual analytics system to support comparative studies of patient records. To make a comparison of sequences with different lengths easier, our system incorporates a sequence alignment method. Through its interactive interface, the user can quickly identify patients of interest and conveniently review both the temporal and multivariate aspects of the patient records. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and system with case studies using a real-world dataset from the neonatal intensive care unit of UC Davis.",e g prediction of heart sent ed as a single vector that has the same length as other patients failure 36 hospital re admission 50 and the best diagnosis all o making possible computing the similarities of the patients records cation 30 and they are often black box models i e difficult to We have also developed an interactive visual analytics system to understand why the model makes a particular prediction When dia g facilitate comparative study of similar medical records The system nosing and treating a patient accessing to information about previous helps clinicians effectively compare records with different lengths by patients who had similar medical conditions to the current patient would employing a dynamic time warping 52 based alignment Also the s ys help the clinicians make more confident decisions along with their do tem provides overviews that are designed to help find salient changes main knowledge and past experiences 20 Also reviewing similar in clinical progressions Additionally to support finding patients who medical records helps clinicians gain a deeper understanding of the have taken similar tests from a sparse data set we visualize this similar progression patterns of a certain disease 53 it y information with dimensionality reduction and clustering methods However identifying and analyzing similar medical records is a Using these functionalities with linked views showing detailed in for challenging task due to the characteristics of E MR data E MRs are mati on clinicians can understand how and why patients are similar often high dimensional e g many different medical tests irregular or which aspects are different eventhough they are generally similar i e patients have different data collection time points and intervals Lastly we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and system with according to when they visit hospitals and sparse e g some patients case studies using a data set obtained from the Neonatal Intensive Care take only specific medical tests among many others 28 Therefore Unit of UC Davis to identify similar medical records we are in need of a similarity calculation method that can handle all of these characteristics Also as 2 RELATED WORK for the analysis comparison of such complex data becomes a crucial In this section we survey the relevant works in 1 visual analytics task of healthcare data and similar data records and 2 methods to measure To address the challenges of handling high dimensionality ir re gu the similarity of medical records lari ty and sparsity first we have developed a method for identifying 2 1 Visual Analytics of Healthcare and Similar Data Corresponding author E mail rong chen guo 1020 gmail com Records Department of Computer Science Bei hang University Recognizing the growing availability of healthcare data fromE MRs Department of Computer Science University of California Davis and Electronic Health Records E HRs researchers have developed var Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine University of California Davis io us visual analytics methods These methods have focused on a wide Department of Surgery University of California Davis range of topics such as clinical decision support systems CDS S 3 20 interpret able machine learning for medical decisions 19 27 29 34 and exploration of disease internal progressions 12 26 Among the works above temporal event sequence visualization s of healthcare data closely relate to our work These works focus on,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"We present a novel adversarial detection and correction method for machine learning classifiers.The detector consists of an autoencoder trained with a custom loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the classifier predictions on the original and reconstructed instances.The method is unsupervised, easy to train and does not require any knowledge about the underlying attack. The detector almost completely neutralises powerful attacks like Carlini-Wagner or SLIDE on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and remains very effective on CIFAR-10 when the attack is granted full access to the classification model but not the defence. We show that our method is still able to detect the adversarial examples in the case of a white-box attack where the attacker has full knowledge of both the model and the defence and investigate the robustness of the attack. The method is very flexible and can also be used to detect common data corruptions and perturbations which negatively impact the model performance.

"In this paper, we propose a machine learning model, which dynamically changes the features during training. Our main motivation is to update the model in a small content during the training process with replacing less descriptive features to new ones from a large pool. The main benefit is coming from the fact that opposite to the common practice we do not start training a new model from the scratch, but can keep the already learned weights. This procedure allows the scan of a large feature pool which together with keeping the complexity of the model leads to an increase of the model accuracy within the same training time. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated in several classic machine learning scenarios including linear regression and neural network-based training. As a specific analysis towards signal processing, we have successfully tested our approach on the database MNIST for digit classification considering single pixel and pixel-pairs intensities as possible features.",in the saving of a remarkably amount of training time new model from the scratch but can keep the already learned Besides regression our approach works similarly for cl as weights This procedure allows the s can of a large feature pool s if i cation scenario us As for our practical example we have which together with keeping the complexity of the model leads examined the M NIST data set and considered single pixel and to an increase of the model accuracy within the same training pixel pairs intensities as possible features time The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated in several classic machine learning scenarios including Linear Regression and There area wide literature of the features election methods neural network based training As a specific analysis towards see e g 1 2 3 4 5 The methods can differ in the signal processing we have successfully tested our approach on search strategies and in the criterion they used to calculate the database M NIST for digit classification considering single the relevance of the selected feature set There exist methods pixel and pixel pairs intensities as possible features which start from a minimal set of features and try to find Index Terms machine learning updating model weights Linear Regression neural networks image classification the proper number and set of features see 6 7 while other methods start from a complicated model and reduce the number of used features via a selection algorithm see 8 9,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In todays global economy, accuracy in predicting macro-economic parameters such as the foreign the exchange rate or at least estimating the trend correctly is of key importance for any future investment. In recent times, the use of computational intelligence-based techniques for forecasting macroeconomic variables has been proven highly successful. This paper tries to come up with a multivariate time series approach to forecast the exchange rate (USD/INR) while parallelly comparing the performance of three multivariate prediction modelling techniques: Vector Auto Regression (a Traditional Econometric Technique), Support Vector Machine (a Contemporary Machine Learning Technique), and Recurrent Neural Networks (a Contemporary Deep Learning Technique). We have used monthly historical data for several macroeconomic variables from April 1994 to December 2018 for USA and India to predict USD-INR Foreign Exchange Rate. The results clearly depict that contemporary techniques of SVM and RNN (Long Short-Term Memory) outperform the widely used traditional method of Auto Regression. The RNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) provides the maximum accuracy (97.83%) followed by SVM Model (97.17%) and VAR Model (96.31%).

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown outstanding performance on a wide range of problems in computer vision, graphics, and machine learning, but often require numerous training data and heavy computational resources. To tackle this issue, several methods introduce a transfer learning technique in GAN training. They, however, are either prone to overfitting or limited to learning small distribution shifts. In this paper, we show that simple fine-tuning of GANs with frozen lower layers of the discriminator performs surprisingly well. This simple baseline, FreezeD, significantly outperforms previous techniques used in both unconditional and conditional GANs. We demonstrate the consistent effect using StyleGAN and SNGAN-projection architectures on several datasets of Animal Face, Anime Face, Oxford Flower, CUB-200-2011, and Caltech-256 datasets.

"Fair and unbiased machine learning is an important and active field of research, as decision processes are increasingly driven by models that learn from data. Unfortunately, any biases present in the data may be learned by the model, thereby inappropriately transferring that bias into the decision making process. We identify the connection between the task of bias reduction and that of isolating factors common between domains whilst encouraging domain specific invariance. To isolate the common factors we combine the theory of deep latent variable models with information bottleneck theory for scenarios whereby data may be naturally paired across domains and no additional supervision is required. The result is the Nested Variational AutoEncoder (NestedVAE). Two outer VAEs with shared weights attempt to reconstruct the input and infer a latent space, whilst a nested VAE attempts to reconstruct the latent representation of one image, from the latent representation of its paired image. In so doing, the nested VAE isolates the common latent factors/causes and becomes invariant to unwanted factors that are not shared between paired images. We also propose a new metric to provide a balanced method of evaluating consistency and classifier performance across domains which we refer to as the Adjusted Parity metric. An evaluation of NestedVAE on both domain and attribute invariance, change detection, and learning common factors for the prediction of biological sex demonstrates that NestedVAE significantly outperforms alternative methods.",66 26 Given the disadvantages of adversarial ing these models to identify factors which are common training and the comparable success of V AEs we consider between

"Visualizing high-dimensional data is an essential task in Data Science and Machine Learning. The Centroid-Encoder (CE) method is similar to the autoencoder but incorporates label information to keep objects of a class close together in the reduced visualization space. CE exploits nonlinearity and labels to encode high variance in low dimensions while capturing the global structure of the data. We present a detailed analysis of the method using a wide variety of data sets and compare it with other supervised dimension reduction techniques, including NCA, nonlinear NCA, t-distributed NCA, t-distributed MCML, supervised UMAP, supervised PCA, Colored Maximum Variance Unfolding, supervised Isomap, Parametric Embedding, supervised Neighbor Retrieval Visualizer, and Multiple Relational Embedding. We empirically show that centroid-encoder outperforms most of these techniques. We also show that when the data variance is spread across multiple modalities, centroid-encoder extracts a significant amount of information from the data in low dimensional space.

"Automated decision making is used routinely throughout our everyday life. Recommender systems decide which jobs, movies, or other user profiles might be interesting to us. Spell checkers help us to make good use of language. Fraud detection systems decide if a credit card transactions should be verified more closely. Many of these decision making systems use machine learning methods that fit complex models to massive datasets. The successful deployment of machine learning (ML) methods to many (critical) application domains crucially depends on its explainability. Indeed, humans have a strong desire to get explanations that resolve the uncertainty about experienced phenomena like the predictions and decisions obtained from ML methods. Explainable ML is challenging since explanations must be tailored (personalized) to individual users with varying backgrounds. Some users might have received university-level education in ML, while other users might have no formal training in linear algebra. Linear regression with few features might be perfectly interpretable for the first group but might be considered a black-box by the latter. We propose a simple probabilistic model for the predictions and user knowledge. This model allows to study explainable ML using information theory. Explaining is here considered as the task of reducing the ""surprise"" incurred by a prediction. We quantify the effect of an explanation by the conditional mutual information between the explanation and prediction, given the user background.",in Algorithm 1 u i 1 P i cid 88 x i 22 j Algorithm 1 XML Algorithm j P i Input explanation sparsity s training samples cid 0 x i y i u i cid 1 for i 1 m as a reasonable summary of the features x i x i We refer to the Python notebook https g it hub 1 compute cid 98 by solving j j P i com alex jung aalto Research Public blob master it xml ip yn b for m the results of the experiments cid 98 arg min cid 88 cid 0 y i u i Tx i cid 1 2 20 cid 107 cid 107 0 s i 1 VI CONCLUSION Output feature set E cid 98 supp cid 98 We have introduced a simple probabilistic model for the predictions of a ML method and the user background The user background is represented by a summary of the features Note that Algorithm 1 is interactive since the user has to of a data point The effect of an explanation is measured by provide samples u i of its summary for the data points with the conditional MI between prediction and explanation given features x i Based on the user input u i for i 1 m the user summary of a data point Algorithm 1 learns an optimal subset E of features 10 that are used for the explanation of predictions 1 The data is freely available via the online map service https kart ta hel fi,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

We then introduce a novel generative algorithm giving trained u-MPS the ability to efficiently sample from a wide variety of conditional distributions, each one defined by a regular expression. Special cases of this algorithm correspond to autoregressive and fill-in-the-blank sampling, but more complex regular expressions permit the generation of richly structured data in a manner that has no direct analogue in neural generative models.

"Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) is a useful tool for efficiently learning probabilistic models in machine learning. Generally approximate posteriors learned by ADVI are forced to be unimodal in order to facilitate use of the reparameterization trick. In this paper, we show how stratified sampling may be used to enable mixture distributions as the approximate posterior, and derive a new lower bound on the evidence analogous to the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE). We show that this ""SIWAE"" is a tighter bound than both IWAE and the traditional ELBO, both of which are special instances of this bound. We verify empirically that the traditional ELBO objective disfavors the presence of multimodal posterior distributions and may therefore not be able to fully capture structure in the latent space. Our experiments show that using the SIWAE objective allows the encoder to learn more complex distributions which regularly contain multimodality, resulting in higher accuracy and better calibration in the presence of incomplete, limited, or corrupted data.",with both deterministic models containing no latent variable and with those containing only a single component parameter i zing the latent space 4 a True posterior b SEL BO posterior c Score function pos d SI WAE posterior teri or Figure 2 We sample the true posterior along with each of the learned implicit posteriors for the observed data point 1 1 We see that theSE LB O and score function trained posteriors are unable to capture all 4 modes of the true posterior distribution In Appendix C 5 and Appendix C 6 are additional experiments exploring extensions to those in the main body of the paper 4 1 Toy Problem We define a latent variable model where the true posterior is multi modal by construction with the hope of recovering the distinct modes Specifically we sample 1000 data points from the following two dimensional generative model z N 0 I x N cid 0 z 2 I cid 1 where 2 5 e 2 i e we first sample a latent z from anisotropic normal but observe z with some Gaussian noise For an observed x there are 4 distinct modes in z space that could have generated it since z is two dimensional We initialize the variation al posterior q z x as a multilayer perce ptr on MLP with 2 layers of 100 hidden units that outputs a 4 component mixture of Gaussian s distribution We evaluate three different estimators of the EL BO 1 SEL BO 2 SI WAE and 3 a score function estimator as a baseline We fit the posterior for 1000 epochs with a batch size of 32 and using the Adam King ma and Ba 2014 optimizer with a learning rate of 0 001 using 10 importance samples for SI WAE and 100 for both SEL BO and score function Each baseline was initialized and trained identically same initial weights and order of batches We measure performance using a 106 sampleS IWA E estimate and observe that the SI WAE trained estimator achieves the highest value of 1 505 compared to 2 024 and 2 038 from the SEL BO and score function estimators respectively Investigating further we plot samples from each of the implicit importance weighted posteriors in the latent space We find that in many cases the SEL BO and score function posteriors are unable to capture the four distinct modes see Figure 2 whereas the higher variance SI WAE posterior is able to cover the modes successfully We also observe similar results to those found in Rain for the tal 2018 where tighter variation al bounds result in lower signal to noise ratios in the gradients to the posterior This is reflected by on average higher variance gradients while training aS IWA E posterior vs aS EL BO posterior 1 16 vs 0 48 average element wise variance respectively However the score function estimator has significantly higher empirical variance 261 4 than that of both SI WAE and SEL BO indicating that the variance reduction coming from the use of there parameter iz ation trick offsets the additional variance from a tighter variation al bound We also found that using the sticking the landing st l estimator Roe der et al 2017 Figure C 2 Figure C 3 does not significantly improve theSE L BOorS IWA E in the toy experiment 4 2 Single Column M NIST Classification To evaluateS IWA E s efficacy on a more challenging problem we trained a class i fier on the benchmark data set M NIST LeC une tal 1998 The class i fier is a Variation al Information Bottleneck VI B model Alem iet al 2017 a variant of the VAE where the decoder outputs a class rather than a reconstructed input To better motivate the use of mixtures on this data set we consider the problem of classification under incomplete information In particular Doers ch 2016 shows that training a VAE using only the center most column of the image introduces multi modality into the data set that is difficult to capture using a uni modal encoder We replicate this multi modality in the classification setting by taking the center most column of each training image An example of a corrupted input can,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach to privacy preservation and two major technical challenges prevent a wider application of federated learning. One is that federated learning raises high demands on communication, since a large number of model parameters must be transmitted between the server and the clients. The other challenge is that training large machine learning models such as deep neural networks in federated learning requires a large amount of computational resources, which may be unrealistic for edge devices such as mobile phones. The problem becomes worse when deep neural architecture search is to be carried out in federated learning. To address the above challenges, we propose an evolutionary approach to real-time federated neural architecture search that not only optimize the model performance but also reduces the local payload. During the search, a double-sampling technique is introduced, in which for each individual, a randomly sampled sub-model of a master model is transmitted to a number of randomly sampled clients for training without reinitialization. This way, we effectively reduce computational and communication costs required for evolutionary optimization and avoid big performance fluctuations of the local models, making the proposed framework well suited for real-time federated neural architecture search.",is algorithms In offline evolutionary NAS the parameters of a given to clarify the differences between the offline and real newly generated offspring model are randomly reinitialized time evolutionary optimization frameworks and trained from scratch before the model is evaluated on a validation data set requiring a large amount of computational resources What is worse the performance of the reinitialized A Federated Learning models will dramatically degrade making the offline opt i miz a As mentioned before federated learning is an emerging tion approach infeasible for realtime application of federated decentralized privacy preserving model training technology learning such as online recommendation systems 21 that enables local users to training a global model without Therefore offline federated evolutionary optimization of uploading their private local data to a central server A con ven neural networks is not applicable to the real world applications t ional federated learning algorithm called federated averaging and it is highly desirable to develop a framework for real time Fed Avg algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1 In the following federated evolutionary neural architecture search The main we briefly introduce this algorithm contributions of this work are summarized as follows,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Security is an increasing concern in software development. Developer Question and Answer (Q&A) websites provide a large amount of security discussion. Existing studies have used human-defined rules to mine security discussions, but these works still miss many posts, which may lead to an incomplete analysis of the security practices reported on Q&A websites. Traditional supervised Machine Learning methods can automate the mining process; however, the required negative (non-security) class is too expensive to obtain. We propose a novel learning framework, PUMiner, to automatically mine security posts from Q&A websites.

So, to achieve high accuracy, we propose a multi-head CNN model comprising of three CNNs to extract features for the data acquired from different sensors and all three CNNs are then merged, which are followed by an LSTM layer and a dense layer. The configuration of all three CNNs is kept the same so that the same number of features are obtained for every input to CNN. By using the proposed method, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, which is comparable to traditional machine learning algorithms and other deep neural network algorithms.",in Section V Finally the

"Active learning (AL) selects the most beneficial unlabeled samples to label, and hence a better machine learning model can be trained from the same number of labeled samples. Most existing active learning for regression (ALR) approaches are supervised, which means the sampling process must use some label information, or an existing regression model. This paper considers completely unsupervised ALR, i.e., how to select the samples to label without knowing any true label information. We propose a novel unsupervised ALR approach, iterative representativeness-diversity maximization (iRDM), to optimally balance the representativeness and the diversity of the selected samples. Experiments on 12 datasets from various domains demonstrated its effectiveness. Our iRDM can be applied to both linear regression and kernel regression, and it even significantly outperforms supervised ALR when the number of labeled samples is small.",Save the sorted indices of theM samples to the next row of P Extensive experiments are performed in this section to demonstrate the performance of the proposed iR DM end c c 1 3 1 Datasets end A summary of the 12 datasets used in our experiments are shown in Table 1 They cover a wide variety Table 1 Summary of the 12 regression datasets of application domains Eleven datasets are from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 1 and the CMU Stat Lib No of No of No of No of Datasets Archive 2 which have also been used in many pre No of Data set raw numerical categorical total vio us A LR experiments Cai et al 2017 Cai et al 2013 samples features features features features Yu and Kim 2010 Wu 2019 Wu et al 2019 We also used Concrete CS 103 7 7 0 7 an affective computing data set Vera amMit tag V AM Vera Yacht 308 6 6 0 6 at Noon in English Grim metal 2008 which has been auto MPG 392 7 6 1 9 used in many previous studies Grimm and K ros chel 2007 NO 2 500 7 7 0 7 Grim metal 2007 Wu and Huang 2020 Only arousal in Housing 506 13 13 0 13 V AM was used as the regression output CP S 534 10 7 3 19 Two datasets auto MPG and CP S contain both numerical EE Cooling 768 7 7 0 7 V AM Arousal 947 46 46 0 46 and categorical features For them we used one hot encoding Concrete 1 030 8 8 0 8 to covert the categorical values into numerical values before Airfoil 1 503 5 5 0 5 A LR For each data set we normalized each dimension of the Wine Red 1 599 11 11 0 11 input to mean zero and standard deviation one Wine White 4 898 11 11 0 11 3 2 Algorithms We compared iR DM c 5 with the following nine sam 2 P ALICE Pool based Active Learning using the max p ling approaches including four unsupervised sampling ap Importance weighted least squares learning based on p roaches Conditional Expectation of the generalization error,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Machine learning methods with quantitative imaging features integration have recently gained a lot of attention for lung nodule classification. However, there is a dearth of studies in the literature on effective features ranking methods for classification purpose. Moreover, optimal number of features required for the classification task also needs to be evaluated. In this study, we investigate the impact of supervised and unsupervised feature selection techniques on machine learning methods for nodule classification in Computed Tomography (CT) images. The research work explores the classification performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine(SVM) when trained with 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 highly ranked features from supervised and unsupervised ranking approaches. The best classification results were achieved using SVM trained with 8 radiomic features selected from supervised feature ranking methods and the accuracy was 100%. The study further revealed that very good nodule classification can be achieved by training any of the SVM or Naive Bayes with a fewer radiomic features.

"When applying machine learning/statistical methods to the environmental sciences, nonlinear regression (NLR) models often perform only slightly better and occasionally worse than linear regression (LR). The proposed reason for this conundrum is that NLR models can give predictions much worse than LR when given input data which lie outside the domain used in model training. Continuous unbounded variables are widely used in environmental sciences, whence not uncommon for new input data to lie far outside the training domain. For six environmental datasets, inputs in the test data were classified as ""outliers"" and ""non-outliers"" based on the Mahalanobis distance from the training input data. The prediction scores (mean absolute error, Spearman correlation) showed NLR to outperform LR for the non-outliers, but often underperform LR for the outliers. An approach based on Occam's Razor (OR) was proposed, where linear extrapolation was used instead of nonlinear extrapolation for the outliers. The linear extrapolation to the outlier domain was based on the NLR model within the non-outlier domain. This NLR$_{\mathrm{OR}}$ approach reduced occurrences of very poor extrapolation by NLR, and it tended to outperform NLR and LR for the outliers. In conclusion, input test data should be screened for outliers. For outliers, the unreliable NLR predictions can be replaced by NLR$_{\mathrm{OR}}$ or LR predictions, or by issuing a ""no reliable prediction"" warning.",from properly regularized nonlinear ML models are only slightly better than traditional linear statistical model results and occasionally worse Yu val and Hsieh 2002 Zeng et al 2011 a 2011 b Peng et al 2017 Mao and Mona han 2018 this conundrum has caused many environmental scientists to be unwilling to use ML methods as ML methods also have the reputation of being black boxes due to their poor interpret ability when compared to the more transparent linear statistical models Why are the ML results not as impressive in the environmental sciences as in the non environmental fields For climate applications the process of averaging daily data to form climate data tends to linear ize the relation between the input and output variables according to the central limit theorem there by diminishing the advantage of the nonlinear ML models Yu val and Hsieh 2002 However even in the absence of the central limit theorem effect nonlinear ML results are still often not much better than linear,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Survival models are used in various fields, such as the development of cancer treatment protocols. Although many statistical and machine learning models have been proposed to achieve accurate survival predictions, little attention has been paid to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates associated with each prediction. The currently popular models are opaque and untrustworthy in that they often express high confidence even on those test cases that are not similar to the training samples, and even when their predictions are wrong. We propose a Bayesian framework for survival models that not only gives more accurate survival predictions but also quantifies the survival uncertainty better. Our approach is a novel combination of variational inference for uncertainty estimation, neural multi-task logistic regression for estimating nonlinear and time-varying risk models, and an additional sparsity-inducing prior to work with high dimensional data.",Using a subset of 47 out of the PAM 50 gene expressions and clinical variables that were common to both TCG A B RCA TCG and META B RIC Curtis et al 2012 datasets we trained on one data set and tested on the other to obtain results on model accuracy We combined both datasets and held out samples at random for experiments on variable importance and uncertainty estimation 3 1 SURVIVAL PREDICTIONS C index and Integrated BrierS core IB S are two commonly used metrics for analyzing the accuracy of survival models for censored data where the former is a generalization of the area under the ROC curve A UC and the latter is the average weighted squared distance between the observed and predicted survival Thus a higher C index and lowe rIBS implies a more accurate model Table 1 shows our method performs better compared to Cox PH MT LR and a comparable neural MT LR model with a single hidden layer Table 1 Comparison of mean std dev C index and IB S across survival models using one of TCG A B RCA and META B RIC datasets for training and the other for testing Methods C index IB S Cox PH 0 65 0 10 0 20 0 07 MT LR 0 68 0 06 0 21 0 06 N MT LR 0 68 0 02 0 16 0 04 Our Method 0 71 0 05 0 12 0 02 3 2 RANKING PROGNOSTIC FEATURES We obtained feature importance for each input feature based on the distribution of weights learned by the network from the first layer to the hidden layer We interpreted the ratio of mean and stan dard deviation of the weight associated with a feature as its signal to noise ratio In case of spike and slab posterior the signal to noise ratio for feature i is given by We ob,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Detecting out of distribution (OOD) samples is of paramount importance in all Machine Learning applications. Deep generative modeling has emerged as a dominant paradigm to model complex data distributions without labels. However, prior work has shown that generative models tend to assign higher likelihoods to OOD samples compared to the data distribution on which they were trained. First, we propose Adversarial Mirrored Autoencoder (AMA), a variant of Adversarial Autoencoder, which uses a mirrored Wasserstein loss in the discriminator to enforce better semantic-level reconstruction. We also propose a latent space regularization to learn a compact manifold for in-distribution samples. The use of AMA produces better feature representations that improve anomaly detection performance. Second, we put forward an alternative measure of anomaly score to replace the reconstruction-based metric which has been traditionally used in generative model-based anomaly detection methods.

"Most research in Bayesian optimization (BO) has focused on \emph{direct feedback} scenarios, where one has access to exact values of some expensive-to-evaluate objective. This direction has been mainly driven by the use of BO in machine learning hyper-parameter configuration problems. However, in domains such as modelling human preferences, A/B tests, or recommender systems, there is a need for methods that can replace direct feedback with \emph{preferential feedback}, obtained via rankings or pairwise comparisons. In this work, we present preferential batch Bayesian optimization (PBBO), a new framework that allows finding the optimum of a latent function of interest, given any type of parallel preferential feedback for a group of two or more points. We do so by using a Gaussian process model with a likelihood specially designed to enable parallel and efficient data collection mechanisms, which are key in modern machine learning. We show how the acquisitions developed under this framework generalize and augment previous approaches in Bayesian optimization, expanding the use of these techniques to a wider range of domains.

"Poisoning attacks have emerged as a significant security threat to machine learning algorithms. It has been demonstrated that adversaries who make small changes to the training set, such as adding specially crafted data points, can hurt the performance of the output model. Some of the stronger poisoning attacks require the full knowledge of the training data. This leaves open the possibility of achieving the same attack results using poisoning attacks that do not have the full knowledge of the clean training set. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of the problem above. Specifically, for the case of feature selection with LASSO, we show that full-information adversaries (that craft poisoning examples based on the rest of the training data) are provably stronger than the optimal attacker that is oblivious to the training set yet has access to the distribution of the data. Our separation result shows that the two setting of data-aware and data-oblivious are fundamentally different and we cannot hope to always achieve the same attack or defense results in these scenarios.",in the context of feature selection in this work we also take initial steps to study the role of adversary s knowledge about the data set when the goal of the attacker is to increase the risk of the produced model in the context of classification These results a represented supplemental material Section A and A 1 1 2 Related Work Here we provide a short version of related prior work A more comprehensive description of pre vio us work has been provided in Appendix B where we also categorize the existing attacks into data aware and data oblivious categories Beats on et al 4 study Blind attackers against machine learning models that do not even know the distribution of the data They show that poisoning attacks could be successful in such a restricted setting by studying them in imax risk of learners They also introduced informed attacks that see the data distribution but not the actual training samples and leave the study of these attacks to future work Interestingly the informed setting of 4 is equivalent to the oblivious setting in our work Xiao et al 74 empirically examine the robustness of features election in the context of poisoning attacks but their measure of stability is across sets of features We are distinct in that our paper studies the effect of data oblivious attacks on individual features and with provable guarantees We distinguish our work with another line of work that studies the computational complexity of the attacker 49 29 Here we study the information complexity of the attack namely what information the attacker needs to succeed in a poisoning attack while those works study the comp u tat ional resources that a poisoning attacker needs to successfully degrade the quality of the learned model Another recent exciting line of work that studies the computational aspect of robust learn ing in poisoning contexts focuses on the computational complexity of the learning process itself 18 43 16 20 21 19 56 22 and other works have studied the same question about the com plex it y of the learning process for evasion attacks 11 10 17 Furthermore our work deals with information complexity and is distinct from works that study the impact of the training set e g using clean labels on the success of poisoning 58 76 62 70 Our work s motivation for data secrecy might seem similar to other works that leverage privacy preserving learning and in particular differential privacy 23 26 25 to limit the power of poisoning attacks by making the learning process less sensitive to poison data 45 However despite seeming similarity what we pursue here is fundamentally different In this work we try to understand the effect of keeping the data secret from adversaries Whereas the robustness guarantees that come from differential privacy has nothing to do with secrecy and hold even if the adversary gets to see the full training set or even select the whole training set in an adversarial way We also point out some separation results in the context of adversarial examples The work of Bu beck et al 12 studies the separation in the power of computationally bounded v s com put a tion ally unbounded learning algorithms in learning robust model Tsi pr as et al 69 studies the separation between benign accuracy and robust accuracy of class if i ers showing that they can be even at odds with each other Schmidt et al 57 show the separation between sample complexity of learning algorithms in training an adversarial ly robust model versus a model with high benign accuracy Gar g et al 29 separate the notions of computationally bounded v s computationally unbounded attacks in successfully generating adversarial examples Although all these results are only proven for few perhaps unrealistic settings they still significantly helped the understanding of adversarial examples,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"New hardware can substantially increase the speed and efficiency of deep neural network training. To guide the development of future hardware architectures, it is pertinent to explore the hardware and machine learning properties of alternative training algorithms. In this work we evaluate the use of small batch, fine-grained Pipelined Backpropagation, an asynchronous pipeline parallel training algorithm that has significant hardware advantages. We introduce two methods, Spike Compensation and Linear Weight Prediction, that effectively mitigate the downsides caused by the asynchronicity of Pipelined Backpropagation and outperform existing techniques in our setting.

"Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be a powerful machine learning tool for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) and disease prediction. A key component in these models is to build a population graph, where the graph adjacency matrix represents pair-wise patient similarities. Until now, the similarity metrics have been defined manually, usually based on meta-features like demographics or clinical scores. The definition of the metric, however, needs careful tuning, as GCNs are very sensitive to the graph structure. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time in the CADx domain that it is possible to learn a single, optimal graph towards the GCN's downstream task of disease classification. To this end, we propose a novel, end-to-end trainable graph learning architecture for dynamic and localized graph pruning. Unlike commonly employed spectral GCN approaches, our GCN is spatial and inductive, and can thus infer previously unseen patients as well. We demonstrate significant classification improvements with our learned graph on two CADx problems in medicine. We further explain and visualize this result using an artificial dataset, underlining the importance of graph learning for more accurate and robust inference with GCNs in medical applications.",We start this section with a proof of concept example showing the ability of our method to retrieve the ground truth graph The remaining of the section is dedicated to comparison with the state of the art methods on two publicly available medical datasets 0 00 0 17 0 29 0 33 0 35 0 027 0 00 0 47 0 48 0 01 0 48 0 48 0 00 0 03 0 00 0 31 0 29 0 00 0 00 0 00 Latent Graph Learning for Disease Prediction 5 Fig 2 Left the ground truth graphs top and output of the graph optimization bottom for 5 and 10 nodes setting The red boxes show errors made by our method and white boxes show successful adj ace n cy reconstruction Right the mean squared error between predicted and ground truth vectors as a function of number of nodes Each curve represents different embedding dimensions 3 1 Proof of concept In order to test the graph learning part of our model we design an experimental setup on simulated data We define a simple optimization problem in which the task is to regress a target vector y associated to each node,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The underlying structure of natural language is hierarchical; words combine into phrases, which in turn form clauses. An awareness of this hierarchical structure can aid machine learning models in performing many linguistic tasks. However, most such models just process text sequentially and there is no bias towards learning hierarchical structure encoded into their architecture. In this paper, we extend the recent transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) by enabling it to learn hierarchical representations. To achieve this, we adapt the ordering mechanism introduced in Shen et al., 2018, to the self-attention module of the transformer architecture. We train our new model on language modelling and then apply it to the task of unsupervised parsing. We achieve reasonable results on the freely available subset of the WSJ10 dataset with an F1-score of about 50%.",Natural language may be spoken and written as a sequence of words but the underlying syntactic structure in language is hierarchical If a sentence is decomposed into its constituents the resulting structure is tree like we refer to this as the sentence s constituency based parse tree These parse trees are crucial for many tasks in natural language processing Obtaining the parse trees for a large corpus of text can be done via human annotation however this can be very time consuming Alternatively supervised syntactic parser s can be used Training these parser s will still require large amounts of annotated text and for many languages such datasets do not exist Unsupervised parsing is therefore of much interest especially in languages that are not as extensively studied training these unsupervised models would not require annotated parse trees One method for training unsupervised parser s is inspired by human language acquisition When nativespeaker s learn their mother tongue they usually gain a rough understanding of the underlying sentence structure even though they are not explicitly given syntactic information This naturally motivates the question of whether the same can be done with neural language models Can deep learning models learn the latent hierarchical structure of a sentence while being trained for next word prediction This would involve modifying the architecture of a deep learning model to incorporate an inductive bias towards learning hierarchical representations These trained hierarchical neural language models could then be used for unsupervised parsing In our work we modify the well known Transformer architecture V aswan iet al 2017 to in corp o rate a bias towards learning latent hierarchical representations We train our modified unidirectional Transformer encoder on language modelling and then apply it to the task of unsupervised parsing We achieve reasonable results for unsupervised parsing on the freely available subset of the WS J 10 data set with anF 1 score of about 50 Our modification of the Transformer architecture is an adaptation of the idea introduced in She net al 2018 here the authors presented a model called the Ordered Neurons Long Short Term Memory ON LSTM network For the standard LSTM as each word is processed information is written to and deleted from the cell state as dictated by the input and forget gates For the ON LSTM the neurons in the cell state are ordered in the sense that if a neuron at a higher position is deleted all preceding neurons must also be deleted The analogy here is that if a larger constituent in a sentence,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Machine learning applications such as finance and medicine demand accurate and justifiable predictions, barring most deep learning methods from use. In response, previous work combines decision trees with deep learning, yielding models that (1) sacrifice interpretability for accuracy or (2) sacrifice accuracy for interpretability. We forgo this dilemma by jointly improving accuracy and interpretability using Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs). NBDTs replace a neural network's final linear layer with a differentiable sequence of decisions and a surrogate loss. This forces the model to learn high-level concepts and lessens reliance on highly-uncertain decisions, yielding (1) accuracy: NBDTs match or outperform modern neural networks on CIFAR, ImageNet and better generalize to unseen classes by up to 16%. Furthermore, our surrogate loss improves the original model's accuracy by up to 2%. NBDTs also afford (2) interpretability: improving human trustby clearly identifying model mistakes and assisting in dataset debugging.

"This work presents a hybrid and hierarchical deep learning model for mid-term load forecasting. The model combines exponential smoothing (ETS), advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ensembling. ETS extracts dynamically the main components of each individual time series and enables the model to learn their representation. Multi-layer LSTM is equipped with dilated recurrent skip connections and a spatial shortcut path from lower layers to allow the model to better capture long-term seasonal relationships and ensure more efficient training. A common learning procedure for LSTM and ETS, with a penalized pinball loss, leads to simultaneous optimization of data representation and forecasting performance. In addition, ensembling at three levels ensures a powerful regularization. A simulation study performed on the monthly electricity demand time series for 35 European countries confirmed the high performance of the proposed model and its competitiveness with classical models such as ARIMA and ETS as well as state-of-the-art models based on machine learning.",in the final solution not being Fig 1 Block diagram of the ETS RD LSTM forecasting system optimal Some classic statistical models such a sETS employ a better way the forecasting model has a built in mechanism Thus each series has a partially unique and partially shared to deal with seasonality The final model uses the optimal model decomposition of the time series Note the hybrid structure of the model where statistical In our approach we use ETS as the preprocessing tool ETS modeling is combined concurrently with ML algorithms The extracts two components from the time series level smoothed model combines ETS advanced LSTM and ense m bling ETS value and seasonality Then we use these components to nor is focused on each individual series and enables the model to mali ze and de seasonal ize the original time series Pre processed capture its main components such as seasonality and level time series are forecasted by RD LSTM ETS and RD LSTM These components are used for time series preprocessing are optimised simultaneously using SGD So the resulting normalization and de season aliz ation forecasting model including data preprocessing is optimized as a whole This distinctive feature of the proposed approach An advanced LSTM based RNN allows non linear trends needs to be emphasized and cross learning This is an extended multilayer version The ETS model used in this study was inspired by the of LSTM with residual dilated LSTM blocks The dilated Holt Winters multiplicative seasonal model However it has recurrent skip connections and spatial shortcut path from been simplified by the removal of the linear trend component lower layers applied in this solution allow the model to This is because the trend forecasting is the task of RD LSTM better capture long term seasonal relationships and ensure which is able to produce a non linear trend which is more more efficient training The RD LSTM model is trained on valuable in our case The updating formulas for the ETS model many time series cross learning To train deep NN s which with a seasonal cycle length of twelve useful for monthly have many parameters cross learning is necessary Moreover data are as follows 27 it enables the method to capture the shared features and components of the time series y l t 1 l ETS and RD LSTM are optimized simultaneously i e the t s t 1 t 1 y ETS parameters and the RD LSTM weights are optimised by s t 1 s SGD at the same time The same overall learning procedure t 12 l t t optimizes the model including data preprocessing So the where y is the time series value at time point t l and s t t t learning process includes representation learning searching are the level and seasonal components respectively and for the most suitable representations of input and output data 0 1 are smoothing coefficients individually for each time series which ensures the most The level equation shows a weighted average between the accurate forecasts It is worth noting the dynamical character seasonally adjusted observation and the level for time t 1 The of the training set which is related to representation learning seasonal equation expresses a seasonal component for time The training set is updated in each epoch of RD LSTM t 12 as a weighted average between a new estimate of the learning This is because SGD updates the ETS parameters in seasonality component y l and the past estimate s Fig t t t each epoch and therefore the level and seasonal components 2 depicts an example of the monthly electricity demand time used for preprocessing are updated as well series and its level and seasonal components obtained from Ense m bling is seen as a much more powerful regular iz ation 1 technique than more popular alternatives e g dropout or The ETS model parameters twelve initial seasonal com po L 2 norm penalty 22 In our case ense m bling combines n ents and two smoothing coefficients for each time series were individual forecasts at three levels stage of training level data adjusted together with RD LSTM weights by SGD Knowing,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Vulnerability detection and safety of smart contracts are of paramount importance because of their immutable nature. Symbolic tools like OYENTE and MAIAN are typically used for vulnerability prediction in smart contracts. As these tools are computationally expensive, they are typically used to detect vulnerabilities until some predefined invocation depth. These tools require more search time as the invocation depth increases. Since the number of smart contracts is increasing exponentially, it is difficult to analyze the contracts using these traditional tools. Recently a machine learning technique called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been used for binary classification, i.e., to predict whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not. This technique requires nearly constant search time as the invocation depth increases. In the present article, we have shown a multi-class classification, where we classify a smart contract in Suicidal, Prodigal, Greedy, or Normal categories. We used Average Stochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM), which is a variant of LSTM, to perform classification. We reduced the class imbalance (a large number of normal contracts as compared to other categories) by considering only the distinct opcode combination for normal contracts. We have achieved a weighted average Fbeta score of 90.0%. Hence, such techniques can be used to analyze a large number of smart contracts and help to improve the security of these contracts.",we train the model with a learning rate that corresponds to the point where the loss reduces most steeply for the first few epochs Figure 2 indicates that 0 03 is the optimal learning rate for first neural network as well as for the class i fier network because after this point the slope of the loss curve is very high Instead of training the whole network with a single learning rate disc rim i native learning rates are used to train the class i fier where learning rates lie in the range of 0 0044 to 0 04 Different layers of the network are trained at different learning rates since they capture different types of information Initial layers of the network are trained at lower learning rates as compared to later layers of the network During classification the encoder part of the network is frozen parameters are not updated initially for few epochs and only the custom head is fine tuned After the elapse of those few epochs the encoder part is gradually unfrozen layer by layer and the network is trained progressively Both the networks are trained using a one cycle training policy 37 where the learning rate is high for initial epochs and reduced significantly for the last epoch These techniques help us in achieving better performance and stable training where the parameters are updated at the correct pace This strategy helps us in taking advantage of the knowledge gained from the language model in the form of a pre trained encoder as articulated in the high level idea mentioned in section 2 2 and helps in obtaining progressively smooth training The code is written in Python using fast a i 38 which is an open source platform to develop deep learning models The code is executed in Google Col laboratory which provides K 80 GPU with 12 GB RAM for free to run machine learning algorithms The Source code and the weights of the neural networks used in this study is available here 39,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Automatic source code summarization is the task of generating natural language descriptions for source code. Automatic code summarization is a rapidly expanding research area, especially as the community has taken greater advantage of advances in neural network and AI technologies. In general, source code summarization techniques use the source code as input and outputs a natural language description. Yet a strong consensus is developing that using structural information as input leads to improved performance. The first approaches to use structural information flattened the AST into a sequence. Recently, more complex approaches based on random AST paths or graph neural networks have improved on the models using flattened ASTs. However, the literature still does not describe the using a graph neural network together with source code sequence as separate inputs to a model. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach that uses a graph-based neural architecture that better matches the default structure of the AST to generate these summaries. We evaluate our technique using a data set of 2.1 million Java method-comment pairs and show improvement over four baseline techniques, two from the software engineering literature, and two from machine learning literature.",IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 35 5 2009 684 702 for Emerging Domains Zheng Li He Jiang GeLi Ming hui Zhou and Ming Li 12 Sergio C ozz etti B de Souza Nicolas Anquetil and Ka thiaM de Oliveira 2005 A Eds Springer Singapore Singapore 3 14 study of the documentation essential to software maintenance In Proceedings of 36 Paul W Mc Burney Cheng Liu and Collin McMillan 2016 Automated feature the 23 rd annual international conference on Design of communication documenting discovery via sentences election and source code sum mari z ation Journal of designing for pervasive information SIG DOC 05 ACM New York NY USA Software Evolution and Process 28 2 2016 120 145 68 75 https doi org 10 1145 1085313 1085331 37 Paul W Mc Burney and Collin McMillan 2016 Automatic source code summa 13 Derek Doran Sarah Schulz and T are kR Be sold 2017 What Does Explain able ri z ation of context for java methods IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering A I Really Mean A New Conceptualization of Perspectives CoRR abs 1710 00794 42 2 2016 103 119 2017 ar Xiv 1710 00794 http ar xiv org abs 1710 00794 38 Tim Miller 2019 Explanation in artificial intelligence Insights from the social 14 Finale Do shi Ve lez and Been Kim 2017 Towards A Rigorous Science of Inter sciences Artificial Intelligence 267 2019 1 38 https doi org 10 1016 j art in t pre table Machine Learning ar Xive prints Article ar Xiv 1702 08608 Feb 2017 2018 07 007 ar Xiv 1702 08608 pages ar Xiv stat ML 1702 08608 39 Laura Moreno and Jair o A ponte 2012 On the analysis of human and automatic 15 Brian P Eddy Jeffrey A Robinson Nicholas A Kraft and Jeffrey C Carver 2013 summaries of source code CLE I Electronic Journal 15 2 2012 2 2 Evaluating source code sum mari z ation techniques Replication and expansion 40 Laura Moreno Jair o A ponte Giri prasad S rid hara Andria n Marcus Lori Pollock In Program Comprehension I CPC 2013 IEEE 21 st International Conference on and K Vijay S hanker 2013 Automatic generation of natural language summaries IEEE 13 22 for java classes In Program Comprehension I CPC 2013 IEEE 21 st International 16 Patrick Fernandes Milt i ad is All a man is and Marc Brock schmidt 2018 Structured Conference on IEEE 23 32 Neural Sum mari z ation CoRR abs 1811 01824 2018 ar Xiv 1811 01824 http 41 Naja mN azar Yan Hu and He Jiang 2016 Summarizing software artifacts ar xiv org abs 1811 01824 A literature review Journal of Computer Science and Technology 31 5 2016 17 Andrew Forward and Timothy C Lethbridge 2002 The relevance of software 883 909 documentation tools and technologies a survey In Proceedings of the 2002 ACM 42 Karl J Otten stein and Linda MOtte nste in 1984 The program dependence graph symposium on Document engineering Doc Eng 02 ACM New York NY USA in a software development environment ACM SIG SOFT Software Engineering 26 33 https doi org 10 1145 585058 585065 Notes 9 3 1984 177 184 18 Jia tao Gu Zheng dong Lu Hang Li and Victor O K Li 2016 Incorporating 43 Kishore Pap in eni Salim Rou kos Todd Ward and Wei Jing Zhu 2002 BLEU a Copying Mechanism in Sequence to Sequence Learning Proceedings of the 54 th method for automatic evaluation of machine translation In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Volume 1 Long 40 th annual meeting on association for computational linguistics Association for Papers 2016 https doi org 10 18653 v 1 p 16 1154 Computational Linguistics 311 318 19 Sonia Hai duc Jair o A ponte Laura Moreno and Andria n Marcus 2010 On the 44 Paige Rode g hero Cheng Liu Paul W Mc Burney and Collin McMillan 2015 use of automated text sum mari z ation techniques for summarizing source code An eye tracking study of java programmers and application to source code Conference 17 July 2017 Washington DC USA LeClair et al sum mari z ation IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 41 11 2015 1038 1054 45 Tobias Roe hm Rebecca Ti arks Rainer Kos ch ke and Walid Maa le j 2012 How do professional developers comprehend software In Proceedings of the 2012 Inter national Conference on Software Engineering ICS E 2012 IEEE Press P is cat away NJ USA 255 265 http dl acm org citation cfm id 2337223 2337254 46 Rib an a Ros cher Bastian Boh n Marco F Duarte and Jochen Garc ke,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hybrid simulation (HS) is a widely used structural testing method that combines a computational substructure with a numerical model for well-understood components and an experimental substructure for other parts of the structure that are physically tested. One challenge for fast HS or real-time HS (RTHS) is associated with the analytical substructures of relatively complex structures, which could have large number of degrees of freedoms (DOFs), for instance. These large DOFs computations could be hard to perform in real-time, even with the all current hardware capacities. In this study, a metamodeling technique is proposed to represent the structural dynamic behavior of the analytical substructure. A preliminary study is conducted where a one-bay one-story concentrically braced frame (CBF) is tested under earthquake loading by using a compact HS setup at the University of Nevada, Reno. The experimental setup allows for using a small-scale brace as the experimental substructure combined with a steel frame at the prototype full-scale for the analytical substructure. Two different machine learning algorithms are evaluated to provide a valid and useful metamodeling solution for analytical substructure. The metamodels are trained with the available data that is obtained from the pure analytical solution of the prototype steel frame. The two algorithms used for developing the metamodels are: (1) linear regression (LR) model, and (2) basic recurrent neural network (RNN). The metamodels are first validated against the pure analytical response of the structure. Next, RTHS experiments are conducted by using metamodels. RTHS test results using both LR and RNN models are evaluated, and the advantages and disadvantages of these models are discussed.",using both LR and RNN models are evaluated and the advantages and disadvantages of these models are discussed Keywords dynamic sub structuring real time hybrid simulation machine learning Linear Regression recurrent neural network INTRODUCTION Hybrid simulation HS is developed to answer the need for realistic dynamic testing of structures that combines experimental and analytical models and benefits from their advantages simultaneously HS was first introduced by Taka nashi et al 1 where it was defined as on line testing and the structural system modeled as a discrete spring mass model within the time domain Since then many researchers were studied in different areas to enlarge the HS capabilities such as developments in numerical integration methods 2 6 sub structuring techniques 7 9 delay compensation and error mitigation 10 12 With these developments this experimental technique became more reliable accurate efficient and cost effective for large scale and full scale real time dynamic testing 13 During the dynamic analysis in HS RTH S the equation of motion for the coupled experimental computational simulations is usually solved by direct numerical integration algorithms However there are still some limitations that exist for these integration algorithms for complex structures where larger degrees of freedoms are involved along with numerical and or experimental nonlinear i ties These limitations could affect the performance and reliability of the HS RTH S To avoid these difficulties and improve the performance of the HS RTH S machine learning algorithms could be an alternative way to represent the analytical substructure Machine learning is the science of programming computers so that they can learn from data 14 The use of machine learning algorithms or meta models became popular recently in engineering problems with the growing complexity of finite element FE models 15 Even with the computational powers that we have today the computational cost for FE models which have large numerical systems could be very high and this led researchers to develop alternative representations of these FE models to predict the dynamic response of the simulation The main idea of this paper is to represent an entire concentric braced frame CBF computational substructure i e columns beam mass and damping with a meta models that is developed using a machine learning algorithm to define the analytical substructure response in HS Moreover the inherent servo hydraulic dynamics in the HS system could lead to a time delay in response to the command of displacement which generates inaccurate results especially in RTH S 16 This time delay is usually eliminated by using a proper delay com pens at or In this paper time delay with the actuator input and the feedback are eliminated within the meta model instead of using a time delay com pens at or To do these a data set for the training model is obtained by the pure analytical model time history analysis of a one bay one story CBF under earthquake excitation The model is considered as batch learning since all the data set are provided offline A Linear Regression LR model and a recurrent neural network RNN model are considered to develop the meta models which predicts the input displacement value for the actuator Once the meta models are trained these are first compared with the pure analytical FE model response The FE model response is considered to be the exact solution of the system Then the meta models are incorporated into the HS loop to conduct preliminary linear tests where the HS test results and model responses can be compared against the exact values from pure FE analysis as well SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND CAPABILITIES A compact HS setup is designed and constructed in the Large Scale Structures Laboratory L SSL at the University of Nevada Reno This small scale setup is developed for CBF demonstrations educational purposes and tackle new research problems pertaining to computational challenges for HS RTH S The analytical substructure can be modeled using either S imu link or Open Sees 17 platform by using proper FE techniques Moreover the HS system is capable of running both real time and pseudo dynamic slow experiments More details about the HS system development and verification can be found in 18 The system consists of 1 load frame with a dynamic actuator run by an isolated hydraulic pump 2 MTS STS controller with 4 channels with 2048 Hz clock speed 3 real time high performance S imu link machine Speed goat xP C Target 4 Windows machine Host PC for MAT LAB Open Sees and the HS middle ware Open Fresco 19 and 5 SCRAM Net ring that provides shared memory locations for real time communication The xP C Target provides a high performance host target prototyping environment that enables the researcher to connect the S imu link and State flow models to physical systems It sends and receives data from the controller The controller STS 493 Hardware Controller has 4 channels with 2048 Hz clock speed and controls the motion of the actuator Currently it has only one channel connected since it is only controlling one actuator but it is capable of controlling 4 actuators STS Host PC is where the basic controller properties are controlled with the graphical user interface of the MTS 493 controller 20 The load frame is the experimental setup for the HS system The dynamic actuator of the system has 7 kip s 31 14 kN maximum load capacity which has 1 in stroke The peak velocity of the actuator at no load is 338 84 mm sec 13 34 in sec The isolated hydraulic power supply system has 8 71 lt min 2 3 gp m pumps and the reservoir capacity of oil volume is 56 78 lt 15 gallons MODELING ASSUMPTIONS The one story one bay steel braced frame is selected for both verification s and evaluations of the system challenges CBF s are ideal for HS testing since the columns and beams are not expected to be damaged during an earthquake and can be accurately modeled in the computer along with the mass and the damping forces i e analytical substructure while the braces can be physically tested to capture buckling accurately and low cycle fatigue induced rupture i e experimental substructure Figure 1 illustrates the CBF sub structuring for HS testing The experimental setup allows for using a small scale brace as the physical substructure along with a steel frame at the prototype full scale for the analytical substructure The HS of this model has been verified against the pure analytical solution of frame and these results are also included in this section Figure 1 Model and sub structuring of CBF s for HS testing Two machine learning algorithms are pursued in this study to develop meta models and explore possibilities to compile a successful HS test First the Linear Regression LR method is used to train a model Secondly a recurrent neural network RNN with different hidden layers and time step delays is modeled and tested for performance Both algorithms are compared with the pure analytical models first Then following the assessment of their performance in the pure analytical model predictions the meta models are further tested in the HS loop with real feedback from the actuator that is free to move without specimen attached as explained later In general an LR model predicts by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features plus a constant called bias term 14 shown in Equation 1 Here is

"In this paper, we propose a system for file classification in large data sets based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). File information contained in key-value metadata pairs is mapped by a novel correlative temporal encoding scheme to spike patterns that are input to an SNN. The correlation between input spike patterns is determined by a file similarity measure. Unsupervised training of such networks using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is addressed first. Then, supervised SNN training is considered by backpropagation of an error signal that is obtained by comparing the spike pattern at the output neurons with a target pattern representing the desired class. The classification accuracy is measured for various publicly available data sets with tens of thousands of elements, and compared with other learning algorithms, including logistic regression and support vector machines. Simulation results indicate that the proposed SNN-based system using memristive synapses may represent a valid alternative to classical machine learning algorithms for inference tasks, especially in environments with asynchronous ingest of input data and limited resources.",in many applications However ANN s that File information contained in key value metadata pairs is mapped require high precision arithmetic are in general inefficient in by a novel correlative temporal encoding scheme to spike patterns terms of power consumption S NN s 3 4 rely on sequences that are input to an S NN The correlation between input spike patterns is determined by a file similarity measure Unsupervised of spikes ones and zeros rather than continuous values training of such networks using spike timing dependent plasticity for neuron al communication and are thus significantly more ST DP is addressed first Then supervised S NN training is efficient than other ANN s 5 Moreover S NN s are particularly considered by back propagation of an error signal that is obtained attractive when inputs are sparse and asynchronous and when by comparing the spike pattern at the output neurons with a learning must be on line and lifelong This is the case in target pattern representing the desired class The classification accuracy is measured for various publicly available data sets data management systems as the files to be classified are with tens of thousands of elements and compared with other often asynchronously ingested Furthermore efficient temporal learning algorithms including Logistic Regression and support encoding schemes could spars if y large streams of files while vector machines Simulation results indicate that the proposed in certain cases the learning must continue for the classification S NN based system using me mri st ive synapses may represent a of new files valid alternative to classical machine learning algorithms for inference tasks especially in environments with asynchronous In this paper we propose a file classification system using ingest of input data and limited resources S NN s where the relevant information contained in key value metadata pairs is mapped by a novel correlative temporal encoding scheme to spike patterns The key value pairs re pre,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Sparsity-inducing regularization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning applications, ranging from feature selection to model compression. In this paper, we present a novel stochastic method -- Orthant Based Proximal Stochastic Gradient Method (OBProx-SG) -- to solve perhaps the most popular instance, i.e., the l1-regularized problem. The OBProx-SG method contains two steps: (i) a proximal stochastic gradient step to predict a support cover of the solution; and (ii) an orthant step to aggressively enhance the sparsity level via orthant face projection. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., Prox-SG, RDA and Prox-SVRG, the OBProx-SG not only converges to the global optimal solutions (in convex scenario) or the stationary points (in non-convex scenario), but also promotes the sparsity of the solutions substantially. Particularly, on a large number of convex problems, OBProx-SG outperforms the existing methods comprehensively in the aspect of sparsity exploration and objective values. Moreover, the experiments on non-convex deep neural networks, e.g., MobileNetV1 and ResNet18, further demonstrate its superiority by achieving the solutions of much higher sparsity without sacrificing generalization accuracy.",in a higher sparsity while sacrifices more on the bias of model estimation hence needs to be carefully fine tuned to achieve both low f x and high sparse solutions Above formulation is widely appeared in many contexts including convex optimization e g LASSO Logistic Regression and elastic net formulations 22 32 and non convex problems such as deep neural networks 29 30 Problem 1 has been well studied in deterministic optimization with various methods that capable of returning solutions with both low objective value and high sparsity under proper Proxima l methods are classical approaches to solve the structured non smooth optimization problems with the formulation 1 including the popular proxima l gradient method Pro x FG and its variants e g IS TA and FIST A 2 in which only the first order derivative information is used They have been proved to be quite useful in practice because of their simplicity Meanwhile first order methods are limited due to the local convergence rate and lack of robustness on ill conditioned problems which can often be overcome by employing the second order derivative information as is used in proxima l Newton methods 18 28 However when N is enormous a straightforward computation of the full gradients or Hessian s could be prohibitive because of the costly evaluations over all N instances Thus in modern large scale machine learning applications it is inevitable to use stochastic methods that operate on a small subset of above summation to economize the computational cost at every iteration Nevertheless in stochastic optimization the studies of cid 96 regular iz ation 1,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Data limitation is one of the most common issues in training machine learning classifiers for medical applications. Due to ethical concerns and data privacy, the number of people that can be recruited to such experiments is generally smaller than the number of participants contributing to non-healthcare datasets. Recent research showed that generative models can be used as an effective approach for data augmentation, which can ultimately help to train more robust classifiers sparse data domains. A number of studies proved that this data augmentation technique works for image and audio data sets.

"GPUs are a key enabler of the revolution in machine learning and high performance computing, functioning as de facto co-processors to accelerate large-scale computation. As the programming stack and tool support have matured, GPUs have also become accessible to programmers, who may lack detailed knowledge of the underlying architecture and fail to fully leverage the GPU's computation power. GEVO (Gpu optimization using EVOlutionary computation) is a tool for automatically discovering optimization opportunities and tuning the performance of GPU kernels in the LLVM representation. GEVO uses population-based search to find edits to GPU code compiled to LLVM-IR and improves performance on desired criteria while retaining required functionality. We demonstrate that GEVO improves the execution time of the GPU programs in the Rodinia benchmark suite and the machine learning models, SVM and ResNet18, on NVIDIA Tesla P100. For the Rodinia benchmarks, GEVO improves GPU kernel runtime performance by an average of 49.48% and by as much as 412% over the fully compiler-optimized baseline. If kernel output accuracy is relaxed to tolerate up to 1% error, GEVO can find kernel variants that outperform the baseline version by an average of 51.08%. For the machine learning workloads, GEVO achieves kernel performance improvement for SVM on the MNIST handwriting recognition (3.24X) and the a9a income prediction (2.93X) datasets with no loss of model accuracy.

"A yuru-chara is a mascot character created by local governments and companies for publicizing information on areas and products. Because it takes various costs to create a yuruchara, the utilization of machine learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be expected. In recent years, it has been reported that the use of class conditions in a dataset for GANs training stabilizes learning and improves the quality of the generated images. However, it is difficult to apply class conditional GANs when the amount of original data is small and when a clear class is not given, such as a yuruchara image. In this paper, we propose a class conditional GAN based on clustering and data augmentation. Specifically, first, we performed clustering based on K-means++ on the yuru-chara image dataset and converted it into a class conditional dataset. Next, data augmentation was performed on the class conditional dataset so that the amount of data was increased five times. In addition, we built a model that incorporates ResBlock and self-attention into a network based on class conditional GAN and trained the class conditional yuru-chara dataset. As a result of evaluating the generated images, the effect on the generated images by the difference of the clustering method was confirmed.",D Evaluation Index A Clustering Result In the present paper we use the geometry score GS 20 proposed by Kh rul kov and Os e led ets as an evaluation index We performed three types of clustering Details of the of model performance and the generated images The GS data set obtained by clustering are shown in Table III In the is based on the manifold hypothesis that data in a high clustering method shown in Figure 3 a they ur u chara image dimensional space can be inclined to manifolds in the lower data set was divided into 10 classes In the clustering method dimensional space here considering GAN training data and shown in Figure 3 b the character image data set was divided generated images as manifolds By using the GS it is possible into 11 classes in the first ResNet clustering and 12 classes in to check how close the properties of the generated image are the second ResNet clustering In the clustering method shown to the training data and to evaluate how much the model can in Figure 3 c the character image data set was divided into learn from the training data However because the number 12 classes in the first ResNet clustering and 16 classes in the of training data and generated images is very large it is second ResNet clustering TABLE IV GS 103 of the generated image obtained from the model trained on each data set RGB data set RGB ResNet data set Edge ResNet data set 12 8 5 5 15 5 performed It was found that the model learned the character is tics of the character well Figure 9 shows the result of interpolating the latent noise by,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Generalization and robustness are both key desiderata for designing machine learning methods. Adversarial training can enhance robustness, but past work often finds it hurts generalization. In natural language processing (NLP), pre-training large neural language models such as BERT have demonstrated impressive gain in generalization for a variety of tasks, with further improvement from adversarial fine-tuning. However, these models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that adversarial pre-training can improve both generalization and robustness. We propose a general algorithm ALUM (Adversarial training for large neural LangUage Models), which regularizes the training objective by applying perturbations in the embedding space that maximizes the adversarial loss. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial training in all stages, including pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training on a well-trained model, and task-specific fine-tuning. ALUM obtains substantial gains over BERT on a wide range of NLP tasks, in both regular and adversarial scenarios. Even for models that have been well trained on extremely large text corpora, such as RoBERTa, ALUM can still produce significant gains from continual pre-training, whereas conventional non-adversarial methods can not. ALUM can be further combined with task-specific fine-tuning to attain additional gains.

"Resonant Beam Charging (RBC) is a wireless charging technology which supports multi-watt power transfer over meter-level distance. The features of safety, mobility and simultaneous charging capability enable RBC to charge multiple mobile devices safely at the same time. To detect the devices that need to be charged, a Mask R-CNN based dection model is proposed in previous work. However, considering the constraints of the RBC system, it's not easy to apply Mask R-CNN in lightweight hardware-embedded devices because of its heavy model and huge computation. Thus, we propose a machine learning detection approach which provides a lighter and faster model based on traditional Mask R-CNN. The proposed approach makes the object detection much easier to be transplanted on mobile devices and reduce the burden of hardware computation. By adjusting the structure of the backbone and the head part of Mask R-CNN, we reduce the average detection time from $1.02\mbox{s}$ per image to $0.6132\mbox{s}$, and reduce the model size from $245\mbox{MB}$ to $47.1\mbox{MB}$.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a well-known technique applied in classification tasks. Various methodologies have been proposed in the literature to select the most relevant features in SVM. Unfortunately, all of them either deal with the feature selection problem in the linear classification setting or propose ad-hoc approaches that are difficult to implement in practice. In contrast, we propose an embedded feature selection method based on a min-max optimization problem, where a trade-off between model complexity and classification accuracy is sought. By leveraging duality theory, we equivalently reformulate the min-max problem and solve it without further ado using off-the-shelf software for nonlinear optimization.

We seek a distributed representation in a latent feature space which can capture the control and data dependencies of tokens appearing on a line of program, while also ensuring lines of similar meaning have similar features. We present a neural architecture, Vulcan, that successfully demonstrates both these requirements. It extracts contextual information about tokens in a line and inputs them as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) paths to a bi-directional LSTM with an attention mechanism. It concurrently represents the meanings of tokens in a line by recursively embedding the lines where they are most recently defined.

"In the machine learning domain, active learning is an iterative data selection algorithm for maximizing information acquisition and improving model performance with limited training samples. It is very useful, especially for the industrial applications where training samples are expensive, time-consuming, or difficult to obtain.

Uncertainties from measurement errors and intrinsic input noise inevitably exist in the experimental data, which further affects the modeling performance.

In this paper, we propose two new active learning algorithms for the Gaussian process with uncertainties, which are variance-based weighted active learning algorithm and D-optimal weighted active learning algorithm.

"Chest radiographs are primarily employed for the screening of pulmonary and cardio-/thoracic conditions. Being undertaken at primary healthcare centers, they require the presence of an on-premise reporting Radiologist, which is a challenge in low and middle income countries. This has inspired the development of machine learning based automation of the screening process. While recent efforts demonstrate a performance benchmark using an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), our systematic search over multiple standard CNN architectures identified single candidate CNN models whose classification performances were found to be at par with ensembles. Over 63 experiments spanning 400 hours, executed on a 11:3 FP32 TensorTFLOPS compute system, we found the Xception and ResNet-18 architectures to be consistent performers in identifying co-existing disease conditions with an average AUC of 0.87 across nine pathologies. We conclude on the reliability of the models by assessing their saliency maps generated using the randomized input sampling for explanation (RISE) method and qualitatively validating them against manual annotations locally sourced from an experienced Radiologist. We also draw a critical note on the limitations of the publicly available CheXpert dataset primarily on account of disparity in class distribution in training vs. testing sets, and unavailability of sufficient samples for few classes, which hampers quantitative reporting due to sample insufficiency.",and Discussion Due to space limitations the absence of the disease ii replacing 1 with 1 U Ones ie detailed performance of all 7 CNN architectures using treating them as presence of the disease and iii masking different ways to handle the uncertain labels and transfer them out to have zero loss during training U Ignore learning protocols during training is available online at The Implementation details are as follows Experiments http bit do Supp l CX R EM BC Tables II IV The spanning 400 hours are performed over a total of 63 combi metrics for the three best performing models are summarized nations obtained across 7 CNN architectures 3 adaptation in Table 1 and compared to the prior art and two Ensemble rules 3 ways to handle uncertain labels models There were no test samples with fracture and less Each CNN model is implemented in Anaconda Python than 9 cases with pneumonia pneumothorax lung lesion and 3 Py Torch 1 0 and trained for 6 epochs 13 963 batch pleural other disease classes in the test set implying that the updates per epoch with a batch size of 16 using Adam 15 results reported for these may not be representative of the optimizer learning rate of 10 4 1 0 9 2 0 999 and actual performance The average Area under the ROC curve a weight decay of 1 10 5 The binary cross entropy loss A UC across the remaining nine classes is reported in the was employed for training without a Soft max operation last column of Table I The ROC plots and the corresponding as multiple diseases could co occur A UC values of the best performing model across the different The models are trained on a Ubuntu 16 04 LTS server with training settings for each of the 7 CNN architectures is 2 Intel Xeon 4110 CPU 12 8 GB DDR 4 RAM 2 2 TB presented in Fig 2 HDD 4 Nvidia GT X 1080 Ti GPU with 11 GB memory Fine tuning F the entire CNN architecture consistently performed the best while employing CNN s with pre trained,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine, also called XGBoost. The overall accuracy achieved by our proposed Pixel R-CNN was 96.5%, which showed considerable improvements in comparison with existing mainstream methods.

"Rapid online adaptation to changing tasks is an important problem in machine learning and, recently, a focus of meta-reinforcement learning. However, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle in POMDP environments because the state of the system, essential in a RL framework, is not always visible. Additionally, hand-designed meta-RL architectures may not include suitable computational structures for specific learning problems. The evolution of online learning mechanisms, on the contrary, has the ability to incorporate learning strategies into an agent that can (i) evolve memory when required and (ii) optimize adaptation speed to specific online learning problems. In this paper, we exploit the highly adaptive nature of neuromodulated neural networks to evolve a controller that uses the latent space of an autoencoder in a POMDP. The analysis of the evolved networks reveals the ability of the proposed algorithm to acquire inborn knowledge in a variety of aspects such as the detection of cues that reveal implicit rewards, and the ability to evolve location neurons that help with navigation. The integration of inborn knowledge and online plasticity enabled fast adaptation and better performance in comparison to some non-evolutionary meta-reinforcement learning algorithms.

"The mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is widely used in training machine learning models, in particular deep learning models. We study SGD dynamics under linear regression and two-layer linear networks, with an easy extension to deeper linear networks, by focusing on the variance of the gradients, which is the first study of this nature. In the linear regression case, we show that in each iteration the norm of the gradient is a decreasing function of the mini-batch size $b$ and thus the variance of the stochastic gradient estimator is a decreasing function of $b$. For deep neural networks with $L_2$ loss we show that the variance of the gradient is a polynomial in $1/b$. The results back the important intuition that smaller batch sizes yield lower loss function values which is a common believe among the researchers. The proof techniques exhibit a relationship between stochastic gradient estimators and initial weights, which is useful for further research on the dynamics of SGD. We empirically provide further insights to our results on various datasets and commonly used deep network structures.",we design a new proof technique where the mini batch size The proof also reveals

"Active learning has been shown to be an effective way to alleviate some of the effort required in utilising large collections of unlabelled data for machine learning tasks without needing to fully label them. The representation mechanism used to represent text documents when performing active learning, however, has a significant influence on how effective the process will be. While simple vector representations such as bag-of-words and embedding-based representations based on techniques such as word2vec have been shown to be an effective way to represent documents during active learning, the emergence of representation mechanisms based on the pre-trained transformer-based neural network models popular in natural language processing research (e.g. BERT) offer a promising, and as yet not fully explored, alternative. This paper describes a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of representations based on pre-trained transformer-based language models for active learning. This evaluation shows that transformer-based models, especially BERT-like models, that have not yet been widely used in active learning, achieve a significant improvement over more commonly used vector representations like bag-of-words or other classical word embeddings like word2vec. This paper also investigates the effectiveness of representations based on variants of BERT such as Roberta, Albert as well as comparing the effectiveness of the [CLS] token representation and the aggregated representation that can be generated using BERT-like models. Finally, we propose an approach Adaptive Tuning Active Learning. Our experiments show that the limited label information acquired in active learning can not only be used for training a classifier but can also adaptively improve the embeddings generated by the BERT-like language models as well.",across 2015 can be brought to active learning while avoiding the many NLP tasks Dev lin et al 2018 Even though word considerable practical challenges of placing a deep neural embedding s and Transformer based language models have network at the heart of the active learning process Zhang been widely applied in text classification there is little et al 2017 Zhao 2017 Siddh ant and Lipton 2018 Zhang work devoted to leveraging them inactive learning for text 2019 7 classification Zhang et al 2017 Zhao 2017 Siddh ant and The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Lipton 2018 and a comprehensive benchmark comp ari Section 2 describes pool based active learning the text son of their usefulness for active learning does not exist in representation techniques used in this paper and existing the literature work related to the use of Transformer based models in ac To address this gap in the literature this paper ad ti ve learning Section 3 describes the experiment com par dresses four research questions ing the effectiveness of different text representation tech ni ques for active learning Section 4 describes the ex peri R Q 1 Are representations generated using pre trained ment that compares the performance of the active learning Transformer based language models more effective process when lightweight and complete variants of BERT than other more commonly used representations in are used as well as the experiment comparing the use of the context of active learning for text labelling If the CLS token representation and aggregate re pre sen so which pre trained model generates the most ef tat ions Section 5 shows the impact that fine tuning the fec ti ve representations Transformer based models has on the active learning pro ces s and finally Section 6 draws conclusions and suggests R Q 2 Can lightweight versions of Transformer based directions for future work models be used instead of the standard large models to reduce the computational burden during active learn ing while still maintaining high performance levels 2 Related Work R Q 3 When using embedding s generated using a In this section we explain what is meant by pool based Transformer based model is it more effective to rep active learning describe the different text representations resent a document using an aggregate of the word that are used in the experiments described in this paper level embedding s produced by the model or to use the and describe existing work that investigates the impact of embedding of the CLS token using different ext representations in active learning R Q 4 Can we further improve the performance of an ac 2 1 Pool based Active Learning ti ve learning system using a Transformer based model The goal of active learning is to utilise a large colle c by fine tuning the model tion of un labelled data for supervised learning with mini To answer these research questions this paper de mal human labelling effort In pool based active learning a scribes a comprehensive evaluation experiment that ex small set of labelled instances is used to seed an initial la plo res the effectiveness of various text representation tech belled data set L Then according to a particular selection ni ques for active learning in a text classification context strategy a batch of data to be presented to an oracle for This evaluation based on 8 datasets from different do labelling is chosen from the un labelled data pool U After main s including product reviews news articles and blog labelling these newly labelled instances will be removed posts shows that representations based on pre trained from U and appended to L This process repeats until a Transformer based language models and especially re pre predefined stopping criterion has been met for example a sent at ions based on RoBERTa consistently outperform the label budget has been exhausted,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box predictors that have achieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, their accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.",In summary most of what the NAM has learned appears to be consistent with medical knowledge though a few details on some of the graphs e g the increase in risk for young patients and the drop in risk for patients with Bilirubin near 35 require further investigation NAM s are attractive models because they often are very accurate while remaining interpret able and if a detail in some graph is found to be incorrect the model can be edited by re drawing the graph However NAM s like all GAM s are not causal models Although the shape plots can be informative and can help uncover problems with the data that might need correction before deploying the models the plots do not tellus why the model learned what it did or what the impact of intervention e g actively lowering a patient s fever or blood pressure would be The shape plots do however tellus exactly how the model makes its predictions A 2 Intelligibility of NAM son other datasets A 2 1 FICO Score Understanding Individual Predictions on Credit Scores The FICO score is a widely used proprietary credit score to determine credit worthiness for loans in the United States The FICO data set 9 is comprised of real world an ony miz ed credit applications made by customers and their assigned FICO Score based on their credit report information We visualize the feature contributions of a NAM trained using the FICO data set see Figure A 4 in appendix for two applicants Table A 3 with low and high scores respectively Figure 5 shows that the most important features for the high scoring applicant are 1 Average Months on File and 2 Net Fraction Revolving Burden i e percentage of credit limit used which take the value 235 months and 0 respectively This makes sense as generally the longer a person s credit history the better it is for their credit score Although there is a strong inverse correlation between,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Despite the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) implementation in electronic medical records (EMRs), Chinese EMRs processing remains challenging due to the limited corpus and specific grammatical characteristics, especially for radiology reports. In this study, we designed an NLP pipeline for the direct extraction of clinically relevant features from Chinese radiology reports, which is the first key step in computer-aided radiologic diagnosis. The pipeline was comprised of named entity recognition, synonyms normalization, and relationship extraction to finally derive the radiological features composed of one or more terms. In named entity recognition, we incorporated lexicon into deep learning model bidirectional long short-term memory-conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF), and the model finally achieved an F1 score of 93.00%. With the extracted radiological features, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression) were used to build the classifiers for liver cancer prediction. For liver cancer diagnosis, random forest had the highest predictive performance in liver cancer diagnosis (F1 score 86.97%, precision 87.71%, and recall 86.25%). This work was a comprehensive NLP study focusing on Chinese radiology reports and the application of NLP in cancer risk prediction. The proposed NLP pipeline for the radiological feature extraction could be easily implemented in other kinds of Chinese clinical texts and other disease predictive tasks.",resulting in the lexicon feature sequence Table 1 We got the word embedding results of character sequence and lexicon feature sequence respectively and then integrated the embedding results together to represent the character sequence Figure 2 The Word 2 Vec was used for word embedding after being pre trained on the Chinese Wikipedia data The BiLSTM layer could capture the dependencies of adjacent tags and learn forward and backward information of input Chinese characters The BiLSTM model was trained by Adam adaptive moment estimation optimization algorithm which was widely used Figure 2 The architecture of BiLSTM CR F model The B L B M I L I M tags indic at s the beginning and inside of the entity type Location Morphology in deep learning We set the number of hidden units to 100 respectively The B I E tags indic at s the Begin Inside and End of one word and the optimizer to Adam Constraints existed in the sequence labeling step since adjacent tags had dependencies After segmentation using the forward maximum matching For example the entity should start with B tag and I tag algorithm we found that the current lexicon could cover all must follow the B tag After the BiLSTM step we applied of the clinically relevant words in these reports The the CR F model to compute the optimal sequence tags specialized lexicon containing clinical terms and lists of In the word level normalization of synonyms entities with synonyms were built based on prior clinical knowledge and the same meaning were unified into a single word according Chinese grammatical characteristics Synonyms involved to the synonym lists generated previously We then extracted different locations of the liver and different presentations of symptom information among the single entities towards the items such as low density irregular computer aided diagnosis Each report was divided into a,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"We use over 350,000 Yelp reviews on 5,000 restaurants to perform an ablation study on text preprocessing techniques. We also compare the effectiveness of several machine learning and deep learning models on predicting user sentiment (negative, neutral, or positive). For machine learning models, we find that using binary bag-of-word representation, adding bi-grams, imposing minimum frequency constraints and normalizing texts have positive effects on model performance. For deep learning models, we find that using pre-trained word embeddings and capping maximum length often boost model performance. Finally, using macro F1 score as our comparison metric, we find simpler models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine to be more effective at predicting sentiments than more complex models such as Gradient Boosting, LSTM and BERT.",when models are trained with imbalanced left and balanced right training sets As we Fig 6 shows the results when models are trained using can see having a balanced training set not only improves the each of the three representation methods through Count Vec model performance it also prevents the model from always to rize r and T f idf Vector ize r in sci kit learn Even though the predicting the majority class e g actual 1 predicted 2 T f idf Vector ize r model has the lowest F 1 score it has higher goes down from 36 6 to 18 7 Although the True Positive True Positive rates for both class 0 and class 1 compared to rate for class 2 decreases from 88 6 to 77 1 this is a both Count Vector ize r models Since the binary variation of reasonable trade off for lower False Negative rates in the other Count Vector ize r achieves the highest F 1 score we will use it two classes for our future experiments Moreover further experiments show that the model trained D Number of N Grams on the down sampled balanced data set outperforms the model trained on the entire training set without any down sampling Let us now investigate the benefit of incorporating n gram despite the difference in sample size Therefore we update our into our model N gram is simply a contiguous sequence of n words For example the text corpus the food is not good The trend for conditional log likelihoods among the has three classes is the same in the uni gram model and the Five 1 gram uni gram words the food is not big ram model For example under both models the word good incredibly has higher log likelihoods for classes 0 and Four 2 gram big ram phrases the food food is is 2 than class 1 This can be interpreted as if someone not not good expresses strong feelings in his her review he she is more likely to be either negative or positive than neutral Adding big ram tri gram or even four gram phrases into our feature space allows us to capture modified verbs and nouns Under the big ram model phrases like incredibly greasy not recommend would not are captured All three phrases thus improve model performance Wang 2012 3 assign a much higher log likelihood to class 0 than to class 2 Eventhough their subset words e g recommend would favour class 2 over class 0 the big ram phrases high log likelihoods more than offset these favours and tilt the prediction in the big ram model to a 99 pro ba bil it y toward class 0 This particular example illustrates the importance of in clu d ing contiguous sequences of words in our model However tri gram model suffers severely from over fitting as the voc ab ul ary size grows too large E Remove Stop words Fig 7 Uni gram left vs Uni gram Big ram middle vs Uni gram Big ram Tri gram right Stop words are commonly used words such as the and to They appear in almost every text corpus so naturally we For our experiment we compare three n gram models would like to remove them from our models uni gram big ram and tri gram Fig 7 shows the results of our experiment As we include more n grams the model tends to over fit since the vocabulary size increases While the True Positive rates for class 0 and 1 both increase it decreases for class 2 Consider one particular text corpus from the test set Food wasn t great My g noc chi was incredibly greasy Would not recommend anyone coming here This review has a ground truth label of 0 While it is correctly predicted by our big ram model our uni gram model thinks that it belongs to class 2 TABLE II CONDITIONAL LOG LIKELIHOODS Uni gram Uni gram Big ram Class 0 Class 1 Class 2 Class 0 Class 1 Class 2 Fig 8 Stop words Not Removed left vs Removed right food 4 878 5 023 5 019 6 127 6 184 6 133 greasy 8 485 8 471 8 792 9 246 9 244 9 616 great 6 531 5 934 5 279 7 404 6 880 6 351 incredibly 8 987 9 464 8 933 9 722 10 191 9 714 TABLE III incredibly greasy 13 790 14 882 16 118 TOP 10 MOST FREQUENT WORDS not 4 665 4 862 5 296 6 038 6 139 6 473 not recommend 9 269 10 747 11 761 Not recommend 7 536 7 561 6 719 8 231 8 314 7 516 Removed Removed would 5 748 5 711 5 921 6 794 6 734 6 919,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"The article explores different deep convolutional neural network architectures trained and tested on posteroanterior chest X-rays of 327 patients who are healthy (152 patients), diagnosed with COVID-19 (125), and other types of pneumonia (48).

"Modern decision-making in fixed income asset management benefits from intelligent systems, which involve the use of state-of-the-art machine learning models and appropriate methodologies. We conduct the first study of bond yield forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, validating its potential and identifying its memory advantage. Specifically, we model the 10-year bond yield using univariate LSTMs with three input sequences and five forecasting horizons. We compare those with multilayer perceptrons (MLP), univariate and with the most relevant features. To demystify the notion of black box associated with LSTMs, we conduct the first internal study of the model. To this end, we calculate the LSTM signals through time, at selected locations in the memory cell, using sequence-to-sequence architectures, uni and multivariate. We then proceed to explain the states' signals using exogenous information, for what we develop the LSTM-LagLasso methodology. The results show that the univariate LSTM model with additional memory is capable of achieving similar results as the multivariate MLP using macroeconomic and market information. Furthermore, shorter forecasting horizons require smaller input sequences and vice-versa. The most remarkable property found consistently in the LSTM signals, is the activation/deactivation of units through time, and the specialisation of units by yield range or feature. Those signals are complex but can be explained by exogenous variables. Additionally, some of the relevant features identified via LSTM-LagLasso are not commonly used in forecasting models. In conclusion, our work validates the potential of LSTMs and methodologies for bonds, providing additional tools for financial practitioners.",as the multivariate MLP with ing to financial assets tend to be limited to forecasting and additional information from markets and the economy comparison of results versus benchmarks Only very few Second we go beyond the application of LS TMs by publications can be found that try to extract additional in conducting an in depth study of the model itself opening formation from the model or study how the model works the black box to understand the representations learned see Section 2 Indeed advances in machine learning en by its internal states Such explanations of what black box able enhanced decision making by e g using new types models learn is a popular topic of interest for certification of data Kraus and Feuer rie gel 2017 and reinforcement and litigation purposes In more detail we extract and learning techniques Ei ler set al 2014 However form a analyse the signals in both states hidden and cell and at chin e learning models to be useful in asset management the gates inside the LSTM memory cell This is the first decision making they need to be trustworthy To achieve contribution to de mystify the notion of blackbox attached this a better understanding of their functioning is crucial to LS TMs using a technique which is fundamentally d if In this field of machine learning more precisely in deep fe rent from the most relevant ones found in the literature learning one of the most successful models for sequence Other studies are applied to a different type of recurrent learning is the long short term memory LSTM networks neural network Giles et al 2001 or perform an external The architecture of this model includes a feedback loop analysis of the model Fischer and Krauss 2018 mechanism that enables the model to remember past in Third and last following the extraction of signals at formation This model has been achieving top results in those locations we proceed to explain the information other scientific fields but has not been used on a broad they contain with exogenous economic and market var i basis in financial applications This will be further de able s For that purpose we develop a new methodology tailed in Section 2 More specifically in the case of bonds here identified as LSTM Lag Lasso based on both Lasso they have not been studied previously with LS TMs This Tib shi rani 1996 and Lag Lasso Mahler 2009 This is an additional gap in the literature despite both the im methodology is capable of identifying both relevant fe a port ance of this asset class in financial markets and the ture s and corresponding lags potential of LS TMs for financial forecasting The discus The remainder of this paper is structured as follows sion of its potential will be the focus of Section 3 2 In Section 2 the literature review is presented In Sec Given the status quo on machine learning research in tion 3 we introduce the theory behind the deep learning bonds the main high level objectives of this study are model used in our research together with its main ad twofold to assess the potential of LSTM networks for vantages limitations and potential for yield forecasting bond yield forecasting testing their memory advantage Section 4 covers the bond yield forecasting study using versus memory free models such as standard feed forward LS TMs versus MLPs Section 5 focuses on the internal neural networks and to de mystify the preconceived no analysis of signals inside the LSTM model while Sec tion of blackbox associated to the LSTM model Together tion 6 details the explanation of those signals using exo these objectives go towards bridging the gaps identified in geno us variables introducing the LSTM La gLas some th the literature and presented above Besides they contrib od ology developed for that purpose Finally in Section 7 ute to improved knowledge and trustworthiness of LSTM the main conclusions are outlined together with direction networks providing asset management practitioners with for future work additional tools for better decision making In more detail our key contributions are as follows 2 Literature review First we conduct an innovative application of a deep learning model LSTM to bonds The results are com The literature review starts by looking at the main app li c pared to memory free multilayer perce ptr on s MLP Our at ions of recurrent neural networks in finance and other results validate the potential of LSTM networks for yield fields Then considering the subset of publications on forecasting This enables their use in intelligent systems forecasting financial assets we analyse in detail the whole,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In this proof-of-concept work, we evaluate the performance of multiple machine-learning methods as statistical emulators for use in the analysis of agent-based models (ABMs). Analysing ABM outputs can be challenging, as the relationships between input parameters can be non-linear or even chaotic even in relatively simple models, and each model run can require significant CPU time. Statistical emulation, in which a statistical model of the ABM is constructed to facilitate detailed model analyses, has been proposed as an alternative to computationally costly Monte Carlo methods. Here we compare multiple machine-learning methods for ABM emulation in order to determine the approaches best suited to emulating the complex behaviour of ABMs. Our results suggest that, in most scenarios, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and gradient-boosted trees outperform Gaussian process emulators, currently the most commonly used method for the emulation of complex computational models. ANNs produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high numbers of model runs, although training times were longer than the other methods. We propose that agent-based modelling would benefit from using machine-learning methods for emulation, as this can facilitate more robust sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption when calibrating and analysing the simulation.",suggest that in most scenarios artificial neural networks ANN s and gradient boosted trees outperform Gaussian Process emulators currently the most commonly used method for the emulation of complex computational models ANN s produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high numbers of model runs although training times were longer than the other methods We propose that agent based modelling would benefit from using machine learning methods for emulation as this can facilitate more robust sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption when calibrating and analysing the simulation Introduction In this paper we investigate the use of machine learning based surrogate modelling for the analysis of agent based models A BMs In this approach machine learning methods are used to generate statistical models that replicate the behaviour of the original A BM to a high degree of accuracy these surrogates are substantially faster to run than the original model enabling complex sensitivity analyses to be performed much more efficiently This proof of concept work demonstrates that these methods are applicable and useful even in time and resource limited modelling contexts and that these surrogates are capable of closely replicating the behaviour of the original model even when minimal hyper parameter optimisation is performed We propose that incorporating such methods into standard A BM practice may allow a significant improvement in the standard of results reporting in certain disciplines particularly in July 27 2021 1 23,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"It is complicated to distinguish among thousands of plant species in the natural ecosystem, and many efforts have been investigated to address the issue. In Vietnam, the task of identifying one from 12,000 species requires specialized experts in flora management, with thorough training skills and in-depth knowledge.

"Building a scalable machine learning system for unsupervised anomaly detection via representation learning is highly desirable. One of the prevalent methods is using a reconstruction error from variational autoencoder (VAE) via maximizing the evidence lower bound. We revisit VAE from the perspective of information theory to provide some theoretical foundations on using the reconstruction error, and finally arrive at a simpler and more effective model for anomaly detection. In addition, to enhance the effectiveness of detecting anomalies, we incorporate a practical model uncertainty measure into the metric. We show empirically the competitive performance of our approach on benchmark datasets.",Fig 3 shows the distortion rate functions on datasets Depending on we arrive at differ entR and D points As expected when is increased the resulting R values get decreased which is what we have expected in Section 3 It is noted that as decreased R D gets increased meaning distortion rate functions on these datasets are sub optimal which is due to the joint distribution p x x By means of using the powerful encoder decoder or imposing an appropriate prior we could shrink the gap to the optimal rate distortion tradeoff more but this is out of our scope One can also find similar results from 8 6 2 Anomaly Detection Performances Baselines We compare our method PG N with other deep anomaly detection baselines for the anomaly detection task We have considered three baselines using the reconstruction error as their anomaly score including naive Autoencoder A E variation al Autoencoder VAE 6 and adversarial Autoencoder A A E 28 We also have considered Deep SV DD DSV DD 11 and GP ND 35 as baselines Datasets and Experiment Protocol We have used M NIST FM NIST and CI FAR 10 as benchmark datasets We used official split training and test sets for all datasets We took data of one class in the pre split training set as our training set thus our training set consists of all normal instances while our test set is the same as the pre split test set The test instances except for instances having the class label of the training set are deemed anomalies M NIST FM NIST and CI FAR 10 have 10 classes each So we conducted 10 independent anomaly detection experiments for each data set The number of anomalies is about 9 times more than that of normal instances in test datasets Architectures and Experiment Settings The architectures of A E A A E VAE are the same as those in Section 6 1 For VAE we also have used the re parameter iz ation trick 6 with L 10 A AEs train the model in adversarial learning and need the disc rim in at or to discriminate between the generated latent variables of inputs and values sampled from the marginal prior This disc rim in at or consists of three fully connected layers with the number of weights of J 512 512 256 and 256 1 respectively and each layer is followed by Leaky Re LU activation s with 0 1 Architectures of DSV DD and PG N are identical the encoder of the Autoencoder architecture We also have considered hyper sphere collapse as reported in 11 meaning that the model with bias terms can produce a trivial solution for DSV DD We found that hyper sphere collapse can also occur in our PG N setting so we did not use any bias terms in both PG N and DSV DD Also PG N outputs the mean and variance values of isotropic multivariate Gaussian For PG N we have used T 20 forT stochastic forward passes with the dropout pro babi il ty p 0 5 It is noted that only mean outputs involve the MC dropout to consider the model uncertainty as described in Section 4 and Theorem 2 It is reported that a pre training with the Autoencoder for DSV DD is helpful to enhance anomaly detection performance But we did not conduct any pre training for all baselines and PG N for fair comparisons For A E VAE A A E DSV DD and PG N the Adam optimizer 15 is used with a weight decay of 1 e 4 The learning rate is initialized to 1 e 4 and reduced by a factor of 10 at 75 th epochs for all datasets We train for 100 epochs and compare under the AU ROC values on test datasets As stated in Section 2 we treat the anomalies are positive and normal instances are negative so that the anomaly scores of the methods are used for calculating AU ROC values without any fixed thresholds,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hypertension is a potentially unsafe health ailment, which can be indicated directly from the Blood pressure (BP). Hypertension always leads to other health complications. Continuous monitoring of BP is very important; however, cuff-based BP measurements are discrete and uncomfortable to the user. To address this need, a cuff-less, continuous and a non-invasive BP measurement system is proposed using Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal and demographic features using machine learning (ML) algorithms. PPG signals were acquired from 219 subjects, which undergo pre-processing and feature extraction steps. Time, frequency and time-frequency domain features were extracted from the PPG and their derivative signals. Feature selection techniques were used to reduce the computational complexity and to decrease the chance of over-fitting the ML algorithms. The features were then used to train and evaluate ML algorithms. The best regression models were selected for Systolic BP (SBP) and Diastolic BP (DBP) estimation individually. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) along with ReliefF feature selection algorithm outperforms other algorithms in estimating SBP and DBP with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.74 and 3.59 respectively. This ML model can be implemented in hardware systems to continuously monitor BP and avoid any critical health conditions due to sudden changes.",This section summarizes the performance of the machine learning algorithm used in the study As stated earlier 19 different machine learning algorithms were trained and validated It is observed from Table 9 that the features of Table 5 have significant

"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread forecasting is an important task to track the growth of the pandemic. Existing predictions are merely based on qualitative analyses and mathematical modeling. The use of available big data with machine learning is still limited in COVID-19 growth prediction even though the availability of data is abundance. To make use of big data in the prediction using deep learning, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to learn the correlation of COVID-19 growth over time. The structure of an LSTM layer is searched heuristically until the best validation score is achieved. First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the globe. We achieved favorable performance compared with that of the recurrent neural network (RNN) method with a comparable low validation error. The evaluation is conducted based on graph visualization and root mean squared error (RMSE). We found that it is not easy to achieve the same quantity of confirmed cases over time. However, LSTM provide a similar pattern between the actual cases and prediction. In the future, our proposed prediction can be used for anticipating forthcoming pandemics.

"We show how perturbing inputs to machine learning services (ML-service) deployed in the cloud can protect against model stealing attacks. In our formulation, there is an ML-service that receives inputs from users and returns the output of the model. There is an attacker that is interested in learning the parameters of the ML-service. We use the linear and logistic regression models to illustrate how strategically adding noise to the inputs fundamentally alters the attacker's estimation problem. We show that even with infinite samples, the attacker would not be able to recover the true model parameters. We focus on characterizing the trade-off between the error in the attacker's estimate of the parameters with the error in the ML-service's output.",In this section we present a mix of analytical and numerical results We begin with the simplest case of a one co variate Linear Regression model The linearity of the model permits an analytical analysis We then extend the model to the case of Logistic Regression and examine our method s performance We conclude with an analysis of correlated regress or s 4 1 Simple Linear Regression In the simplest case consider the one variable linear machine learning model f x where Given a data set X of queries to induce endo gene it y we define the garbling function of a specific input x as g x x x 2 4 where and are constants and a b is a norm cid 0 al ran do cid 1 m variable with mean a and variance b Given the data set X Y the attacker s estimation function h is the ordinary least squares solution That is the function h for the attacker is choose the parameters and that minimizes N y x 2 where y is the value returned from the ML service Since gives the marginal,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Machine learning tools have illustrated their potential in many significant sectors such as healthcare and finance, to aide in deriving useful inferences. The sensitive and confidential nature of the data, in such sectors, raise natural concerns for the privacy of data. This motivated the area of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML) where privacy of the data is guaranteed. Typically, ML techniques require large computing power, which leads clients with limited infrastructure to rely on the method of Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC). In SOC setting, the computation is outsourced to a set of specialized and powerful cloud servers and the service is availed on a pay-per-use basis. In this work, we explore PPML techniques in the SOC setting for widely used ML algorithms-- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. We propose BLAZE, a blazing fast PPML framework in the three server setting tolerating one malicious corruption over a ring (\Z{\ell}). BLAZE achieves the stronger security guarantee of fairness (all honest servers get the output whenever the corrupt server obtains the same). Leveraging an input-independent preprocessing phase, BLAZE has a fast input-dependent online phase relying on efficient PPML primitives such as: (i) A dot product protocol for which the communication in the online phase is independent of the vector size, the first of its kind in the three server setting; (ii) A method for truncation that shuns evaluating expensive circuit for Ripple Carry Adders (RCA) and achieves a constant round complexity. This improves over the truncation method of ABY3 (Mohassel et al., CCS 2018) that uses RCA and consumes a round complexity that is of the order of the depth of RCA.

"Learning distributed representations of source code has been a challenging task for machine learning models. Earlier works treated programs as text so that natural language methods can be readily applied. Unfortunately, such approaches do not capitalize on the rich structural information possessed by source code. Of late, Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed to learn embeddings of programs from their graph representations. Due to the homogeneous and expensive message-passing procedure, GNN can suffer from precision issues, especially when dealing with programs rendered into large graphs. In this paper, we present a new graph neural architecture, called Graph Interval Neural Network (GINN), to tackle the weaknesses of the existing GNN. Unlike the standard GNN, GINN generalizes from a curated graph representation obtained through an abstraction method designed to aid models to learn. In particular, GINN focuses exclusively on intervals for mining the feature representation of a program, furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling the learning to large graphs. We evaluate GINN for two popular downstream applications: variable misuse prediction and method name prediction. Results show in both cases GINN outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a comfortable margin. We have also created a neural bug detector based on GINN to catch null pointer deference bugs in Java code. While learning from the same 9,000 methods extracted from 64 projects, GINN-based bug detector significantly outperforms GNN-based bug detector on 13 unseen test projects. Next, we deploy our trained GINN-based bug detector and Facebook Infer to scan the codebase of 20 highly starred projects on GitHub. Through our manual inspection, we confirm 38 bugs out of 102 warnings raised by GINN-based bug detector compared to 34 bugs out of 129 warnings for Facebook Infer.",First we compare the performance of GINN resp GINN powered RNN Sandwich against GG NN resp GG NN powered RNN Sandwich Then we investigate the s cal ability of these four neural architectures Later we conduct abl ation studies to gain a

find that GINN powered RNN Sandwich is considerably more precise at reasoning the semantics of a program Below we gave two examples to illustrate our findings For Figure 11 a GINN powered RNN Sandwich is the only model that not only locates but also fixes the misused variable i e orig s ys path highlighted within the shadowbox In contrast all baseline models consider orig s ys path as the correctly used variable which is not totally unreasonable In fact appending an item item when it is not yet in the list orig s ys path is a very common pattern models need to learn However in this case if orig s ys path was the correct variable new s ys path would have been an empty list when being assigned to s ys path 0 in the last line GINN powered RNN Sandwich is capable of capturing the nuance of the semantics this program denotes and not getting trapped by the common programming paradigms As for Figure 11 b GINN and GG NN powered RNN Sandwich also correctly localizes the misused variable request

Sandwich makes the correct prediction end to end S cal ability We further analyze the results we obtained from the previous experiment to investigate the s cal ability of the four neural architectures In particular we divide the entire test set into ten subsets each of which consists of graphs of similar size We then record the performance of all models on each subset starting from the smallest to the largest graphs Note that GG NN at the core of both compared baselines has already had additional edges incorporated into the program graphs to alleviate the s cal ability concern All amani set al 2018 However as explained in Section 1 All amani set al 2018 do not provide a principled guideline as to where exactly to add the edges given a program graph specifically Therefore we can only follow their approach by universally adding all types of edges they proposed 9 in total which we list in Appendix H to all program graphs In contrast we do not incorporate any additional edge apart from those that are present in the graph representation for GINN Figure 12 show show the performance of each model varies with the size of graphs We skip the metric of classification accuracy under which models are largely indistinguishable For localization and joint accuracy we make several observations of the performance trend for each model First GG NN suffers the largest performance drop among all models more than 10 resp 20 under location resp joint accuracy This phenomenon shows there is indeed as cal ability issue with GG NN Second the combination of sequence and graph model helps to make the neural architecture more scalable than GG NN alone Furthermore by replacing GG NN with GINN in RNN Sandwich we obtain a model that is clearly the most scalable Barring few sets of graphs GINN

"Performing machine learning (ML) computation on private data while maintaining data privacy, aka Privacy-preserving Machine Learning~(PPML), is an emergent field of research. Recently, PPML has seen a visible shift towards the adoption of the Secure Outsourced Computation~(SOC) paradigm due to the heavy computation that it entails. In the SOC paradigm, computation is outsourced to a set of powerful and specially equipped servers that provide service on a pay-per-use basis. In this work, we propose SWIFT, a robust PPML framework for a range of ML algorithms in SOC setting, that guarantees output delivery to the users irrespective of any adversarial behaviour. Robustness, a highly desirable feature, evokes user participation without the fear of denial of service. At the heart of our framework lies a highly-efficient, maliciously-secure, three-party computation (3PC) over rings that provides guaranteed output delivery (GOD) in the honest-majority setting. To the best of our knowledge, SWIFT is the first robust and efficient PPML framework in the 3PC setting. SWIFT is as fast as (and is strictly better in some cases than) the best-known 3PC framework BLAZE (Patra et al. NDSS'20), which only achieves fairness. We extend our 3PC framework for four parties (4PC). In this regime, SWIFT is as fast as the best known fair 4PC framework Trident (Chaudhari et al. NDSS'20) and twice faster than the best-known robust 4PC framework FLASH (Byali et al. PETS'20). We demonstrate our framework's practical relevance by benchmarking popular ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression and deep Neural Networks such as VGG16 and LeNet, both over a 64-bit ring in a WAN setting. For deep NN, our results testify to our claims that we provide improved security guarantee while incurring no additional overhead for 3PC and obtaining 2x improvement for 4PC.",against the best known framework BLAZE that provides fairness in the same setting Lemma 4 13 Communication Fig 26 requires We observe that the technique of making the dot product cost dot pt 4 an amortized communication of 4 cid 96 bits in the preprocessing independent of feature size can also be applied to BLAZE to phase and 1 round with amortized communication of 3 cid 96 bits obtain better costs Hence for a fair comparison we addition in the online phase ally report these improved values for BLAZE Further we only consider the PPA circuit based variant of bit extraction Proof The preprocessing phase comprises of the pre process for BLAZE since we aim for high throughput the GC based ing phase of and which results in an amortized variant results in huge communication and is not efficient for dot p 4 t rgen 4 communication of 3 cid 96 cid 96 4 cid 96 bits The online phase follows deep NN s Our result simply that we get GOD at no additional from that of protocol except that now P P compute cost compared to BLAZE For 4 PC we compare our results dot p 4 1 2 shares of z r This requires one round and an amortized with two best known works FLASH 12 which is robust communication cost of 2 cid 96 bits P P then jointly share the and Trident 16 which is fair Our results halve the cost of,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Gaussian processes~(Kriging) are interpolating data-driven models that are frequently applied in various disciplines. Often, Gaussian processes are trained on datasets and are subsequently embedded as surrogate models in optimization problems. These optimization problems are nonconvex and global optimization is desired. However, previous literature observed computational burdens limiting deterministic global optimization to Gaussian processes trained on few data points. We propose a reduced-space formulation for deterministic global optimization with trained Gaussian processes embedded. For optimization, the branch-and-bound solver branches only on the degrees of freedom and McCormick relaxations are propagated through explicit Gaussian process models. The approach also leads to significantly smaller and computationally cheaper subproblems for lower and upper bounding. To further accelerate convergence, we derive envelopes of common covariance functions for GPs and tight relaxations of acquisition functions used in Bayesian optimization including expected improvement, probability of improvement, and lower confidence bound. In total, we reduce computational time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, thus overcoming previous computational burdens. We demonstrate the performance and scaling of the proposed method and apply it to Bayesian optimization with global optimization of the acquisition function and chance-constrained programming. The Gaussian process models, acquisition functions, and training scripts are available open-source within the ""MeLOn - Machine Learning Models for Optimization"" toolbox~(https://git.rwth-aachen.de/avt.svt/public/MeLOn).",from conditioning the prior on training data Finally we describe how hyper parameters of the GP can be adapted to data by a maximum a posterior i MAP estimate 2 1 Prior A GP prior is fully described by its mean function m px q and positive semi definite cov ari ance function k px x 1 q also known as kernel function We consider a noisy observation y from a function f px q with y px q f px q whereby the output noise is noise noise independent and identically distributed i i d with Np 0 2 q We say y is noise noise distributed as a GP i e y G Ppm px q k px x 1 qq with m px q IE f px q k px x 1 q IE py px q m px qq py px 1 q m px qq T Without loss of generality we assume that the prior mean function is m px q 0 This implies that we train the GP on scaled data such that the mean of the training outputs is zero A common class of co variance functions is the Mat ern class 21 k px x 1 q 2 2 r K 2 r Mat ern f p q a where 2 is the output variance r px x 1 qT px x 1 q is a weighted Euclidean f distance dia gp 2 2 2 q is a length scale matrix with P R p q is the,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Tuning hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms is a tedious task, one that is typically done manually. To enable automated hyperparameter tuning, recent works have started to use techniques based on Bayesian optimization. However, to practically enable automated tuning for large scale machine learning training pipelines, significant gaps remain in existing libraries, including lack of abstractions, fault tolerance, and flexibility to support scheduling on any distributed computing framework. To address these challenges, we present Mango, a Python library for parallel hyperparameter tuning. Mango enables the use of any distributed scheduling framework, implements intelligent parallel search strategies, and provides rich abstractions for defining complex hyperparameter search spaces that are compatible with scikit-learn. Mango is comparable in performance to Hyperopt, another widely used library.

"Gaussian process regression has proven very powerful in statistics, machine learning and inverse problems. A crucial aspect of the success of this methodology, in a wide range of applications to complex and real-world problems, is hierarchical modeling and learning of hyperparameters. The purpose of this paper is to study two paradigms of learning hierarchical parameters: one is from the probabilistic Bayesian perspective, in particular, the empirical Bayes approach that has been largely used in Bayesian statistics; the other is from the deterministic and approximation theoretic view, and in particular the kernel flow algorithm that was proposed recently in the machine learning literature. Analysis of their consistency in the large data limit, as well as explicit identification of their implicit bias in parameter learning, are established in this paper for a Mat\'ern-like model on the torus. A particular technical challenge we overcome is the learning of the regularity parameter in the Mat\'ern-like field, for which consistency results have been very scarce in the spatial statistics literature. Moreover, we conduct extensive numerical experiments beyond the Mat\'ern-like model, comparing the two algorithms further. These experiments demonstrate learning of other hierarchical parameters, such as amplitude and lengthscale; they also illustrate the setting of model misspecification in which the kernel flow approach could show superior performance to the more traditional empirical Bayes approach.",are scarce in the spatial statistics literature the techniques we use to prove consistency may be of independent interest and applicable beyond the setting considered here We also include numerical studies concerning the learning of the amplitude pa ra meter and the inverse length scale parameter these experiments contribute to a more complete picture of GP R using the Mat ern like field with hierarchical parameters Moreover we provide numerical experiments for several other well specified models beyond the Mat ern like model thus further extending the scope of discussions 1 4 2 Model Mis specification The second part of this work considers model mis specification the data generating model for u and the model K used for regression do not match We adopt the following setting We model the truth u either as a GP using a variety of co variance fun c t ions or as a deterministic function which solves a P DE The kernel K is chosen to be Green s function of various differential op era tors where encodes information beyond the amplitude length scale and regularity of the field For example we choose to be the location of a discontinuity within a conductivity field In this setting we observe distinct behavior distinguishing EB and KF This raises the discussion of how to choose which algorithm to use when solving practical problems where mis specification is to be expected Our numerical study explores several mis specification possibilities showing that KF could be competitive with EB in certain scenarios,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"This paper describes our system for monolingual sense alignment across dictionaries. The task of monolingual word sense alignment is presented as a task of predicting the relationship between two senses. We will present two solutions, one based on supervised machine learning, and the other based on pre-trained neural network language model, specifically BERT. Our models perform competitively for binary classification, reporting high scores for almost all languages. This paper presents our submission for the shared task on monolingual word sense alignment across dictionaries as part of the GLOBALEX 2020 {--} Linked Lexicography workshop at the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC). Monolingual word sense alignment (MWSA) is the task of aligning word senses across re- sources in the same language. Lexical-semantic resources (LSR) such as dictionaries form valuable foundation of numerous natural language process- ing (NLP) tasks. Since they are created manually by ex- perts, dictionaries can be considered among the resources of highest quality and importance. However, the existing LSRs in machine readable form are small in scope or miss- ing altogether. Thus, it would be extremely beneficial if the existing lexical resources could be connected and ex- panded. Lexical resources display considerable variation in the number of word senses that lexicographers assign to a given entry in a dictionary. This is because the identification and differentiation of word senses is one of the harder tasks that lexicographers face. Hence, the task of combining dictio- naries from different sources is difficult, especially for the case of mapping the senses of entries, which often differ significantly in granularity and coverage. (Ahmadi et al., 2020) There are three different angles from which the problem of word sense alignment can be addressed: approaches based on the similarity of textual descriptions of word senses, ap- proaches based on structural properties of lexical-semantic resources, and a combination of both. (Matuschek, 2014) In this paper we focus on the similarity of textual de- scriptions. This is a common approach as the majority of previous work used some notion of similarity between senses, mostly gloss overlap or semantic relatedness based on glosses. This makes sense, as glosses are a prerequisite for humans to recognize the meaning of an encoded sense, and thus also an intuitive way of judging the similarity of senses. (Matuschek, 2014) The paper is structured as follows: we provide a brief overview of related work in Section 2, and a description of the corpus in Section 3. In Section 4 we explain all impor- tant aspects of our model implementation, while the results are presented in Section 5.

"Fictional prose can be broadly divided into narrative and discursive forms with direct speech being central to any discourse representation (alongside indirect reported speech and free indirect discourse). This distinction is crucial in digital literary studies and enables interesting forms of narratological or stylistic analysis. The difficulty of automatically detecting direct speech, however, is currently under-estimated. Rule-based systems that work reasonably well for modern languages struggle with (the lack of) typographical conventions in 19th-century literature. While machine learning approaches to sequence modeling can be applied to solve the task, they typically face a severed skewness in the availability of training material, especially for lesser resourced languages. In this paper, we report the result of a multilingual approach to direct speech detection in a diverse corpus of 19th-century fiction in 9 European languages. The proposed method finetunes a transformer architecture with multilingual sentence embedder on a minimal amount of annotated training in each language, and improves performance across languages with ambiguous direct speech marking, in comparison to a carefully constructed regular expression baseline.",obtained using this baseline were compared a standardized written language Another challenge results with those of manual annotation to assess its performance from the varying origin of the texts in the sub collections some were contributed from existing open source colle c Language Direct speech conventions t ions while others e g Romanian due to lack of digitized English collections in respective languages were scanned OCR ed French and annotated by the Action members specifically for EL TeC Detailed information on the process and rules gui d German ing the creation of the corpus can be found on the de di Italian cate d website https distant reading g it hub io sampling Norwegian pr o pos al html Portuguese Romanian We use EL TeC as in its first official release in Level 1 en coding basic XML TEI compliant annotation of the texts Serbian division into chapters and paragraphs covering the fol Slovene lowing languages English German Italian French Ro Table 2 Conventions of marking direct speech across lan mani an Slovene Norwegian Portuguese Serbian We do gu ages as accounted for in the baseline the above con not introduce changes in the original texts and select five vent ions apply to non normalized EL TeC corpus but not samples per language of around 10 000 words each with necessarily to the 19 th century typographic traditions in every sample drawn from a different novel We use ran general dom sampling and preserve information about paragraphs and sentences For many European languages with a high degree of stan dar diz ation of typographic conventions this approach is The samples were manually annotated by JB W and A extremely effective For example in English where the with two fold purpose in mind 1 they were used to train words spoken are enclosed in double quotation marks the model 2 they were the golden standard to compare narrator s inclusions are easy to identify therefore the ex baseline performance to At this early stage of the project ample sentence I see said Rachel it is the same fig we did not calculate inter an not at or agreement as in the ure but not the same shaped picture may be captured case of some languages with which only one of us would using simple regular expression Other languages be familiar the texts were annotated twice by the same like French not only use different symbols for quotations person In the next stage of the project we plan to involve but also tend to omit them in dialogues for the in i the Action members in providing and verifying an not a ti al dashes Despite this the performance of the rules t ions which will allow us to examine the quality of the based approach decreases only slightly annotations better Language Paragraphs Script Direct speech ratio Language Precision Recall Accuracy F 1 score English 989 Latin 0 684 English 0 98 0 99 0 99 0 98 French 1394 Latin 0 450 Slovene 0 99 0 97 0 99 0 98 German 987 Latin 0 756 Portuguese 0 95 0 94 0 96 0 94 Italian 662 Latin 0 308 Romanian 0 90 0 94 0 94 0 92 Norwegian 979 Latin 0 334 German 0 99 0 86 0 94 0 92 Portuguese 1573 Latin 0 583 French 0 92 0 92 0 95 0 92 Romanian 1522 Latin 0 597 Italian 0 87 0 88 0 94 0 88 Serbian 1278 Cyrillic 0 572 Serbian 0 90 0 85 0 93 0 87 Slovene 1809 Latin 0 392 Norwegian 0 72 0 59 0 84 0 65 Table 1 Sample summaries and direct speech ratio word level Table 3 Performance of regular expression baseline in direct speech detection on manually annotated samples However frequently the formal structure of a compound sentence delimited by commas does not allow distinguish ing the narration from the direct speech for the baseline As for instance in the sentences Et la bonne Rosalie la gou vern ante de Fr d ric l ac comp agne sans do ute Ich I and Je ne demand era is pas mieux d it ALBERT en re gar bin I dant madame Mans ley With the lack of clear separation der sel ben I of the direct speech which is often the case for the early Mein ung I 19 th century editions baseline performance drops sub O st anti ally for the German sample without proper marks it rie f O achieves 0 68 accuracy and only 0 18 recall F 1 0 04 Benno O T nnchen O Other common problems include no clear mark at the end e if rig O of an utterance no difference in marking direct speech,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"A dialog system that can monitor the health status of seniors has a huge potential for solving the labor force shortage in the caregiving industry in aging societies. As a part of efforts to create such a system, we are developing two modules that are aimed to correctly interpret user utterances: (i) a yes/no response classifier, which categorizes responses to health-related yes/no questions that the system asks; and (ii) an entailment recognizer, which detects users{'} voluntary mentions about their health status. To apply machine learning approaches to the development of the modules, we created large annotated datasets of 280,467 question-response pairs and 38,868 voluntary utterances. For question-response pairs, we asked annotators to avoid direct {``}yes{''} or {``}no{''} answers, so that our data could cover a wide range of possible natural language responses. The two modules were implemented by fine-tuning a BERT model, which is a recent successful neural network model. For the yes/no response classifier, the macro-average of the average precisions (APs) over all of our four categories (Yes/No/Unknown/Other) was 82.6{\%} (96.3{\%} for {``}yes{''} responses and 91.8{\%} for {``}no{''} responses), while for the entailment recognizer it was 89.9{\%}.",for our yes no re lion webpages s pons e class i fier when we trained and tested models with We used the morphological analyzer Me Cab Main Easy or both When both the training and test sets Kudo et al 2004 9 and the dictionary Ju man Dic are from Main the YES category achieved a nAP score of Kuro has hie tal 1994 to token ize Japanese sentences 95 4 and the NO category has an AP score of 89 6 into words throughout this study UN K and OTHER have lower AP scores and the macro average over the four categories was 81 7 7 To estimate the number of noises introduced by this as sump When we built the Main data set we asked an not at or s not to tion an not at or s checked 5 000 instances that were randomly sam include such simple answers as yes and Ido None the pled from the negative instances in Original We found that 15 less the model trained with Main performed better when 0 3 out of the 5 000 utterance statement pairs were positive it is tested with Easy which consists of such simple an which indicates that around 140 000 instances are falsely labeled s wer s than when it was tested with Main This is possibly as negative in Original 8 In preliminary studies we also created smaller datasets by because a small number of erroneous inclusion of simple randomly sampling negative instances but this did not contribute answers or the similarity between the simple answers and to the overall performance in neural network experiments more complex answers were sufficient to predict Easy with 9 https taku 910 g it hub io me cab a considerably high precision,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"In recent years, the increasing interest in the development of automatic approaches for unmasking deception in online sources led to promising results. Nonetheless, among the others, two major issues remain still unsolved: the stability of classifiers performances across different domains and languages. Tackling these issues is challenging since labelled corpora involving multiple domains and compiled in more than one language are few in the scientific literature. For filling this gap, in this paper we introduce DecOp (Deceptive Opinions), a new language resource developed for automatic deception detection in cross-domain and cross-language scenarios. DecOp is composed of 5000 examples of both truthful and deceitful first-person opinions balanced both across five different domains and two languages and, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest corpus allowing cross-domain and cross-language comparisons in deceit detection tasks. In this paper, we describe the collection procedure of the DecOp corpus and his main characteristics. Moreover, the human performance on the DecOp test-set and preliminary experiments by means of machine learning models based on Transformer architecture are shown.",reviews To this end the introduced corpus contains have been collected up to 5 opinions per writer allowing author based analyses 5 1 Human Performance In this section an assessment of human performance in de Cross language As noted already currently it s unclear if tec ting deceptive opinions in the typed text on the De cOp verbal clues indicative of deceit can be assumed to be test set is performed This procedure is necessary for at stable regardless of the language employed from the least two reasons First of all previous studies revealed sender Since De cOp was compiled with the same pro that humans are weak lie detectors with accuracy rates ce dure in more than one language it provides the pos only slightly above the chance level Bond Jr and De Paulo sibi lit y of assessing the class if i ers performances on 2006 A a mod t and Custer 2006 and this is one of the different languages in the detection of deceit main reasons why automated classification approaches in The available data has been split into training and test sets detecting deceit are becoming so popular Thus low hu The training set consists of opinions from 400 writers per man performances in this task would support the validity language whereas the test set contains the remaining 100 of our corpus On the other hand this validation procedure writers The test writers have been uniformly sampled from will provide a precise baseline against which the automated the 4 HITs As a consequence the labels distribution is pre classification model performances maybe compared served We release the De cOp corpus and this training test Relying again on the AMT service 100 Turk ers located in split and the code to performs basic and useful operations 1 the US gender F 78 M 22 age M 36 8 SD 10 5 The same split has been used in our experimental assess and 100 located in Italy gender F 74 M 26 age M ment described in Section 5 26 6 SD 7 9 were recruited The task was restricted to the Turk ers whose approval rating was equal to or greater,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"The motivation behind this work lies in the need to differentiate between similar signs that differ in non-manual components present in any sign. To this end, we recorded full sentences signed by five native signers and extracted 5200 isolated sign samples of twenty frequently used signs in Kazakh-Russian Sign Language (K-RSL), which have similar manual components but differ in non-manual components (i.e. facial expressions, eyebrow height, mouth, and head orientation). We conducted a series of evaluations in order to investigate whether non-manual components would improve sign{'}s recognition accuracy.

"The BERT model has arisen as a popular state-of-the-art machine learning model in the recent years that is able to cope with multiple NLP tasks such as supervised text classification without human supervision. Its flexibility to cope with any type of corpus delivering great results has make this approach very popular not only in academia but also in the industry. Although, there are lots of different approaches that have been used throughout the years with success. In this work, we first present BERT and include a little review on classical NLP approaches. Then, we empirically test with a suite of experiments dealing different scenarios the behaviour of BERT against the traditional TF-IDF vocabulary fed to machine learning algorithms. Our purpose of this work is to add empirical evidence to support or refuse the use of BERT as a default on NLP tasks. Experiments show the superiority of BERT and its independence of features of the NLP problem such as the language of the text adding empirical evidence to use BERT as a default technique to be used in NLP problems.",obtained by BERT in different NLP tasks at 7 In this work we compare BERT model 7 with a traditional machine learning NLP approach that trains machine learning algorithms in features retrieved by the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency T F IDF 29 algorithm as a representative of these traditional approaches 24 With this technique we avoid the construction of a linguistic resource that need expert supervision simulating it with the punctuation retrieved for any term by the T F IDF technique We lose precision by doing this operation but gain recall We have carried out four different experiments about text classification In all of them we have used two different class if i ers BERT and a traditional cl as si fier created in the way that we have just explained In this work we start by presenting some related work then we describe the models we have used in our experiments after that we describe the experiments we have carried out and show the obtained results and finally we present the conclusions drawn from the work and some future lines of work Comparing BERT against traditional machine learning text classification 3,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can potentially meet the high data-rate requirements of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, as the prerequisite of mmWave communications, the narrow directional beam tracking is very challenging because of the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and attitude variation of UAVs. Aiming to address the beam tracking difficulties, we propose to integrate the conformal array (CA) with the surface of each UAV, which enables the full spatial coverage and the agile beam tracking in highly dynamic UAV mmWave networks. More specifically, the key contributions of our work are three-fold. 1) A new mmWave beam tracking framework is established for the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network. 2) A specialized hierarchical codebook is constructed to drive the directional radiating element (DRE)-covered cylindrical conformal array (CCA), which contains both the angular beam pattern and the subarray pattern to fully utilize the potential of the CA. 3) A codebook-based multiuser beam tracking scheme is proposed, where the Gaussian process machine learning enabled UAV position/attitude predication is developed to improve the beam tracking efficiency in conjunction with the tracking-error aware adaptive beamwidth control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed codebook-based beam tracking scheme in the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network, and demonstrate the advantages of CA over the conventional planner array in terms of spectrum efficiency and outage probability in the highly dynamic scenarios.",validate the high rate data transmission among U A Vs is of great the effectiveness of the proposed code book based beam tracking importance to the development of I oT with large scale video scheme in the CA enabled U AV mm Wave network and demon data or high definition image data transmission requirements st rate the advantages of CA over the conventional planner array in terms of spectrum efficiency and outage probability in the In addition U A Vs can also be used as flying base stations highly dynamic scenarios or mobile relay back haul nodes to provide on the fly high capacity communication links for the emergency coverage of Index Terms Millimeter wave beam tracking conform al I oT devices 7 8 array code book design error processing In such mission driven U AV networks high data rate inter U AV communications play a pivotal role Mm Wave band has abundant spectrum resource and is considered as a po Copyright c 20 xx IEEE Personal use of this material is permitted tent i al avenue to support high throughput data transmission However permission to use this material for any other purposes must be obtained from the IEEE by sending a request to pubs permissions ieee org for U AV networks 7 9 10 If the Line of Sight LoS This work was supported in part by the National Key R D Program of propagation is available mm Wave communication can achieve China No 2019 Y FC 1511302 the National Natural Science Foundation of kilometer level communication range and gigabits per second China under Grant No 61871057 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 2019 XD A 13 in part by the U S National Science data rate 11 which can support U AV networks in many Foundation under grants US CNS 1350230 CAREER CNS 1702850 CNS scenarios 6 7 9 However there are critical challenges to 1801925 and CNS 2029569 in part by US Multidisciplinary University achieve reliable mm Wave communications for U AVnet works Research Initiative 18 RT 0073 NSF EARS 1839818 CNS 1717454 CNS 1731424 and CNS 1702850 and in part by B UP T Excellent Ph D Students Specifically aU AV maintains three dimensional or full spatial Foundation CX 2020202 mobility with very high dynamic and thus the angle of arrival J Zhang and W Xu are with key Lab of Universal Wireless Com mu nica AO A of communication signal always varies overtime in all t ions Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecom muni cations Beijing 100876 China E mail z jing lin w j xu b up t edu cn Corre directions To this end a powerful antenna array is important s pond ing author Wen jun Xu to offer full spatial coverage capability and facilitate the H Gao is with Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and mm Wave link maintenance for U AV networks The uniform Service Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecom mu ni cations Beijing 100876 China E mail hui gao b up t edu cn linear array UL A and uniform planar array UP A are widely M Pan is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering adopted in the existing studies on mm Wave communication University of Houston Houston TX 77204 USA and networking 12 15 However their coverage cap a bil Z Han is with the University of Houston Houston TX 77004 USA and also with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering Kyung Hee i ties are often confined within a two dimensional space and University Seoul South Korea 446 701 a half three dimensional space Therefore conventional UL A P Zhang is with State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching and UP A can only attain a limited coverage within a fraction of Technology Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing 100876 China the full space causing high communication outage probability,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"We introduce ADAHESSIAN, a second order stochastic optimization algorithm which dynamically incorporates the curvature of the loss function via ADAptive estimates of the HESSIAN. Second order algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties as compared to first order methods such as SGD and Adam. The main disadvantage of traditional second order methods is their heavier per iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in ADAHESSIAN, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian diagonal elements. We show that ADAHESSIAN achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of Adam. In particular, we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that ADAHESSIAN: (i) achieves 1.80%/1.45% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55% higher accuracy on ImageNet as compared to Adam; (ii) outperforms AdamW for transformers by 0.13/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 2.7/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; (iii) outperforms AdamW for SqueezeBert by 0.41 points on GLUE; and (iv) achieves 0.032% better score than Adagrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset.

"Structural damage detection has become an interdisciplinary area of interest for various engineering fields, while the available damage detection methods are being in the process of adapting machine learning concepts. Most machine learning based methods heavily depend on extracted ``hand-crafted"" features that are manually selected in advance by domain experts and then, fixed. Recently, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance on traditional challenging tasks, such as image classification, object detection, etc., due to the powerful feature learning capabilities. This breakthrough has inspired researchers to explore deep learning techniques for structural damage detection problems. However, existing methods have considered either spatial relation (e.g., using convolutional neural network (CNN)) or temporal relation (e.g., using long short term memory network (LSTM)) only. In this work, we propose a novel Hierarchical CNN and Gated recurrent unit (GRU) framework to model both spatial and temporal relations, termed as HCG, for structural damage detection. Specifically, CNN is utilized to model the spatial relations and the short-term temporal dependencies among sensors, while the output features of CNN are fed into the GRU to learn the long-term temporal dependencies jointly. Extensive experiments on IASC-ASCE structural health monitoring benchmark and scale model of three-span continuous rigid frame bridge structure datasets have shown that our proposed HCG outperforms other existing methods for structural damage detection significantly.",in CV tasks such as image classification 22 image segmentation 28 and object detection CNN s can extract features be cause of two key properties spatially shared weights and spatial pooling while recurrent neural networks RNNs based methods can generate and address memories of arbitrary length sequences of input patterns 29 RNN attempts to map from the entire history of previous inputs to target vectors in principle and allows a memory of previous inputs kept in the networks internal state RNNs are usually utilized for supervised learning tasks with sequential input data such as sentiment classification 8 and target outputs GRU is a simple and yet powerful variant of RNNs for sequence modeling tasks due to the gated mechanism 10 11 14 GRU is carefully designed to memorize historical in for mati on and fuse current states new inputs and historical information together in a re currently gated way The successful applications of deep learning have inspired several attempts to address the challenge of structural damage identification These work can be mainly classified into three categories multilayer perce ptr on MLP CNN s and RNNs based methods as discussed in the following i Guo et al used the sparse coding neural network as the feature extraction model and theMLP as the class i fier for structural damage identification ii Abdel jaber 2 et al proposed a structural damage feature extraction and recognition model based on CNN s Bao 4 et al proposed a CNN based method which first converted the time series data collected by S HM into an image and then utilized CNN to learn the features of the converted images iii Zhao 30 et al proposed a RNN based feature extraction method for collected time series data to identify machine conditions These pioneering attempts have presented superior performance for st ruc t ural damage detection compared with previous methods based on traditional prediction methods However none of the work considers both spatial relations of different sensors and temporal sequential relations simultaneously In add i,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Reinforcement learning is a popular machine learning paradigm which can find near optimal solutions to complex problems. Most often, these procedures involve function approximation using neural networks with gradient based updates to optimise weights for the problem being considered. While this common approach generally works well, there are other update mechanisms which are largely unexplored in reinforcement learning. One such mechanism is Extreme Learning Machines. These were initially proposed to drastically improve the training speed of neural networks and have since seen many applications. Here we attempt to apply extreme learning machines to a reinforcement learning problem in the same manner as gradient based updates. This new algorithm is called Extreme Q-Learning Machine (EQLM).

We qualitatively show that by optimizing a pairwise ranking loss and leveraging learning curves from other datasets, our model is able to effectively rank learning curves without having to observe many or very long learning curves. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to accelerate a neural architecture search by a factor of up to 100 without a significant performance degradation of the discovered architecture.

"Coreset is usually a small weighted subset of $n$ input points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, that provably approximates their loss function for a given set of queries (models, classifiers, etc.). Coresets become increasingly common in machine learning since existing heuristics or inefficient algorithms may be improved by running them possibly many times on the small coreset that can be maintained for streaming distributed data. Coresets can be obtained by sensitivity (importance) sampling, where its size is proportional to the total sum of sensitivities. Unfortunately, computing the sensitivity of each point is problem dependent and may be harder to compute than the original optimization problem at hand. We suggest a generic framework for computing sensitivities (and thus coresets) for wide family of loss functions which we call near-convex functions. This is by suggesting the $f$-SVD factorization that generalizes the SVD factorization of matrices to functions. Example applications include coresets that are either new or significantly improves previous results, such as SVM, Logistic regression, M-estimators, and $\ell_z$-regression.

"Is a deep learning model capable of understanding systems governed by certain first principle laws by only observing the system's output? Can deep learning learn the underlying physics and honor the physics when making predictions? The answers are both positive. In an effort to simulate two-dimensional subsurface fluid dynamics in porous media, we found that an accurate deep-learning-based proxy model can be taught efficiently by a computationally expensive finite-volume-based simulator. We pose the problem as an image-to-image regression, running the simulator with different input parameters to furnish a synthetic training dataset upon which we fit the deep learning models. Since the data is spatiotemporal, we compare the performance of two alternative treatments of time; a convolutional LSTM versus an autoencoder network that treats time as a direct input. Adversarial methods are adopted to address the sharp spatial gradient in the fluid dynamic problems. Compared to traditional simulation, the proposed deep learning approach enables much faster forward computation, which allows us to explore more scenarios with a much larger parameter space given the same time. It is shown that the improved forward computation efficiency is particularly valuable in solving inversion problems, where the physics model has unknown parameters to be determined by history matching. By computing the pixel-level attention of the trained model, we quantify the sensitivity of the deep learning model to key physical parameters and hence demonstrate that the inversion problems can be solved with great acceleration. We assess the efficacy of the machine learning surrogate in terms of its training speed and accuracy.

"Entropy is ubiquitous in machine learning, but it is in general intractable to compute the entropy of the distribution of an arbitrary continuous random variable. In this paper, we propose the amortized residual denoising autoencoder (AR-DAE) to approximate the gradient of the log density function, which can be used to estimate the gradient of entropy. Amortization allows us to significantly reduce the error of the gradient approximator by approaching asymptotic optimality of a regular DAE, in which case the estimation is in theory unbiased. We conduct theoretical and experimental analyses on the approximation error of the proposed method, as well as extensive studies on heuristics to ensure its robustness. Finally, using the proposed gradient approximator to estimate the gradient of entropy, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on density estimation with variational autoencoders and continuous control with soft actor-critic.",taken from posterior and approximates the data distribution accurately Meschede re tal 2017 Model log p x M NIST We first demonstrate the robustness of our Models with a trained prior method on different choices of architectures for VAE 1 V LAE Che net al 2016 79 03 a one hidden layer fully connected network denoted by Pixel HVAE Vamp Prior To mc zak Welling 2018 79 78 MLP 2 a convolutional network denoted by Con v and Models without a trained prior 3 a larger convolutional network with residual connections VAEIA F King mae tal 2016 79 88 denoted by Res Con v from Huan get al 2018 The first VAEN AF Huan get al 2018 79 86 two architectures are taken from Meschede re tal 2017 for Diagonal Gaussian 81 43 a direct comparison with the adversarial ly trained implicit IV IAR DAE ours 79 61 variation al posteriors A VB We also implement adi ago Table 2 Statically bin a rize dM NIST nal Gaussian baseline and the auxiliary hierarchical method H VI aux Ma al e et al 2016 We apply AR DAE to estimate the entropy gradient of the hierarchical posterior and the implicit posterior denoted by HV IAR DAE and IV IAR DAE respectively As shown in Table 1 AR DAE Figure 6 Generated samples the mean value of the decoder of consistently improves the quality of inference in comp ari the IV IAR DAE trained on statically bin a rize dM NIST son to the auxiliary variation al method and A VB which is reflected by the better likelihood estimates tri but ion p x Since the marginal likelihood is usually data We then compare our method with state of the art V AEs intractable the standard approach is to maximize the evi evaluated on the statically b inari zed M NIST data set den ce lower bound EL BO La rochelle Murray 2011 We use the implicit d is tri but ion with theRe sC on v architecture following the prev i log p x E log p x z log q z x 6 z q z x o usa bl ation As shown in Table 2 the VAE trained with AR DAE demonstrates state of the art performance among where q z x is an amortized variation al posterior dist rib u models with a fixed prior Generated samples a represented tion The EL BO allows us to jointly optimize p x z and in Figure 6 q z x with a unified objective Note that the equality holds iff q z x p z x which mo 6 3 Entropy regularized reinforcement learning ti vates using more flexible families of variation al posterior We now apply AR DAE to approximate entropy gradient in Note that this is more challenging for two reasons the target the context of reinforcement learning RL We use the soft distribution p z x is constantly changing and is conditional actor critic SAC Ha arno jae tal 2018 a state of the art Similar to Meschede re tal 2017 we parameter ize a con off policy algorithm for continuous control that is designed d it ional sampler z g cid 15 x cid 15 N 0 I with an implicit to encourage exploration by regularizing the entropy of the q z x We use AR DAE to approximate log q z x and z policy We train the policy a s to minimize the following estimate the entropy gradient to update the encoder while objective maximizing the EL BO To train AR DAE instead of fix,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Objectives: To investigate machine-learning classifiers and interpretable models using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other pneumonias, ILD and normal CTs. Methods: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2096 chest CTs from 16 institutions (including 1077 COVID-19 patients). Training/testing cohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and 559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of airspace opacities. Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83, sensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and 0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for other pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness of our method against different compositions of control groups. Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imaging features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and classification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosis of COVID-19.",We evaluated the ability of machine learning algorithms to distinguish between chest CT s in patients with C OVID 19 and a diverse control cohort comprising of chest CT s demonstrating other pneumonia s IL D and no pathology We performed an analysis based on clinically interpret able severity metrics computed from automated segmentation of abnormal regions in a chest CT s can as well as using a deep learning system Unsupervised clustering on selected severity metrics shows that while there are dominant characteristics that can be observed in C OVID 19 such as ground glass opa cities as well as peripheral and basal distribution these are not observed in all cases of C OVID 19 On the other hand some IL D and other pneumonia patients can exhibit similar characteristics We found that the performance of the system can be improved by mapping these metrics into a higher dimensional space prior to training a class i fier as shown by model M 2 in Figure 3 The best classification accuracy is achieved by the deep learning system which is essentially a high dimensional non linear model The deep learning method achieves reduced false positive and false negative rates relative to the metrics based class i fier suggesting that there might be other latent radiological manifestations of C OVID 19 that distinguish it from I LDs or other types of pneumonia It is worthy investigating how to incorporate the common imaging features into our 3 D DL class i fier as prior information The proposed A I based method has been trained and tested on a database of 2362 CT datasets with 1077 C OVID 19,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Deep neural networks and other sophisticated machine learning models are widely applied to biomedical signal data because they can detect complex patterns and compute accurate predictions. However, the difficulty of interpreting such models is a limitation, especially for applications involving high-stakes decision, including the identification of bacterial infections. In this paper, we consider fast Raman spectroscopy data and demonstrate that a logistic regression model with carefully selected features achieves accuracy comparable to that of neural networks, while being much simpler and more transparent. Our analysis leverages wavelet features with intuitive chemical interpretations, and performs controlled variable selection with knockoffs to ensure the predictors are relevant and non-redundant.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global health concern after its first known detection in December 2019. As a result, accurate and reliable advance warning system for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 has now become a priority. The detection of COVID-19 in early stages is not a straightforward task from chest X-ray images according to expert medical doctors because the traces of the infection are visible only when the disease has progressed to a moderate or severe stage. In this study, our first aim is to evaluate the ability of recent \textit{state-of-the-art} Machine Learning techniques for the early detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Both compact classifiers and deep learning approaches are considered in this study. Furthermore, we propose a recent compact classifier, Convolutional Support Estimator Network (CSEN) approach for this purpose since it is well-suited for a scarce-data classification task. Finally, this study introduces a new benchmark dataset called Early-QaTa-COV19, which consists of 1065 early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia samples (very limited or no infection signs) labelled by the medical doctors and 12 544 samples for control (normal) class. A detailed set of experiments shows that the CSEN achieves the top (over 97%) sensitivity with over 95.5% specificity.

"Person-job fit is to match candidates and job posts on online recruitment platforms using machine learning algorithms. The effectiveness of matching algorithms heavily depends on the learned representations for the candidates and job posts. In this paper, we propose to learn comprehensive and effective representations of the candidates and job posts via feature fusion. First, in addition to applying deep learning models for processing the free text in resumes and job posts, which is adopted by existing methods, we extract semantic entities from the whole resume (and job post) and then learn features for them. By fusing the features from the free text and the entities, we get a comprehensive representation for the information explicitly stated in the resume and job post. Second, however, some information of a candidate or a job may not be explicitly captured in the resume or job post. Nonetheless, the historical applications including accepted and rejected cases can reveal some implicit intentions of the candidates or recruiters. Therefore, we propose to learn the representations of implicit intentions by processing the historical applications using LSTM. Last, by fusing the representations for the explicit and implicit intentions, we get a more comprehensive and effective representation for person-job fit. Experiments over 10 months real data show that our solution outperforms existing methods with a large margin. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of the fused representation.

"We propose a robust variational autoencoder with $\beta$ divergence for tabular data (RTVAE) with mixed categorical and continuous features. Variational autoencoders (VAE) and their variations are popular frameworks for anomaly detection problems. The primary assumption is that we can learn representations for normal patterns via VAEs and any deviation from that can indicate anomalies. However, the training data itself can contain outliers. The source of outliers in training data include the data collection process itself (random noise) or a malicious attacker (data poisoning) who may target to degrade the performance of the machine learning model. In either case, these outliers can disproportionately affect the training process of VAEs and may lead to wrong conclusions about what the normal behavior is. In this work, we derive a novel form of a variational autoencoder for tabular data sets with categorical and continuous features that is robust to outliers in training data. Our results on the anomaly detection application for network traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",The results in Figure 1 show that the performance datasets are in tabular format with categorical and cont in of the vanilla VAE degrades significantly even with a small u o us columns We measured the area under the receiver amount of contamination 1 Our R TVAE on the other operating characteristic curve A UC as an evaluation met hand stays robust to the outliers in the training datasets ric K DD Cup 99 Archive 1999 is the data set used for The 5 Conclusion Third Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools com We derived a formulation on how to use robust divergence petition The task was to build an automated network in in aVAE framework for tabular datasets consisting of cat tru sion detector that can distinguish between attacks and e gorica land continuous features Our results demonstrate normal connections There are 41 columns of which 8 of that additional care needs to betaken when training with them are categorical We use the complementary 10 data contaminated datasets with outliers The R TVAE described for training and the labeled test data for testing here provides robustness with categorical data as shown in N SL K DD for Cyber security is the refined version of Figure 1 K DD Cup 99 to resolve some of the inherent problems in Robust Variation al Autoencoder for Tabular Data with Divergence,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Constructing accurate model-agnostic explanations for opaque machine learning models remains a challenging task. Classification models for high-dimensional data, like images, are often inherently complex. To reduce this complexity, individual predictions may be explained locally, either in terms of a simpler local surrogate model or by communicating how the predictions contrast with those of another class. However, existing approaches still fall short in the following ways: a) they measure locality using a (Euclidean) metric that is not meaningful for non-linear high-dimensional data; or b) they do not attempt to explain the decision boundary, which is the most relevant characteristic of classifiers that are optimized for classification accuracy; or c) they do not give the user any freedom in specifying attributes that are meaningful to them. We address these issues in a new procedure for local decision boundary approximation (DBA). To construct a meaningful metric, we train a variational autoencoder to learn a Euclidean latent space of encoded data representations. We impose interpretability by exploiting attribute annotations to map the latent space to attributes that are meaningful to the user. A difficulty in evaluating explainability approaches is the lack of a ground truth. We address this by introducing a new benchmark data set with artificially generated Iris images, and showing that we can recover the latent attributes that locally determine the class. We further evaluate our approach on tabular data and on the CelebA image data set.",We train a 5 layer CNN c 0 1 on the training data to learn the pro b X ability of class A The corresponding binary classifications are f x 1 if c x 0 5 and f x 1 otherwise See Appendix C for details The CNN achieves 99 33 accuracy on the training data and 98 75 accuracy on the test set which is sufficiently high that on images from the same source its decision boundary must be very similar to the ground truth specified by the two hyper planes As described in Appendix C we further train a convolutional VAE on the training data The VAE achieves 90 label stability on the test set up from 74 without our adjustment to favor preservation of class probabilities We compareD BA At t to the CEM MA F pertinent negative method 25 We also want to compare to LIME but since LIME 34 and A LIME 38 do not have the option to learn user specified attributes from annotations we instead com p are to a hybrid method LIME At t which is a variant of DB A At t in which we have replaced the detection and simulation steps by LIME We also include a non local baseline that we call the Global method Global is given an advantage because it gets as features the original parameters PL PW C used to generate the images but it is also at a disadvantage because it fits a global linear model in terms of these parameters so it cannot exploit locality We run DB A At t with k 1000 m 500 andr tuned automatically from grid 0 1 0 2 0 9 1 1 5 2 9 5 10 For details about the other meth R od s s ee Appendix C DB A At t LIME At t and Global all output a coe f fic i ent vector Rp that expresses the relative importance of the attributes This correspond s to a direction cid 80 p in the latent space where j 1 j j Z Rl are the coefficients of the an not at or for attribute j see Section 2 1 j CEM MA F outputs a contrastive example x but as described in Appendix C c it may also be used to obtain a direction in the latent space and a vector of coefficients for the attributes x 0 1 xb 0 5 xj 0 Figure 2 Illustration of DB A At t detection and sampling steps A First Impression Before reporting aggregate statistics for multiple exp la nations we first illustrate our results on a single representative input image x,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Sub-seasonal climate forecasting (SSF) focuses on predicting key climate variables such as temperature and precipitation in the 2-week to 2-month time scales. Skillful SSF would have immense societal value, in areas such as agricultural productivity, water resource management, transportation and aviation systems, and emergency planning for extreme weather events. However, SSF is considered more challenging than either weather prediction or even seasonal prediction. In this paper, we carefully study a variety of machine learning (ML) approaches for SSF over the US mainland. While atmosphere-land-ocean couplings and the limited amount of good quality data makes it hard to apply black-box ML naively, we show that with carefully constructed feature representations, even linear regression models, e.g., Lasso, can be made to perform well. Among a broad suite of 10 ML approaches considered, gradient boosting performs the best, and deep learning (DL) methods show some promise with careful architecture choices. Overall, suitable ML methods are able to outperform the climatological baseline, i.e., predictions based on the 30-year average at a given location and time. Further, based on studying feature importance, ocean (especially indices based on climatic oscillations such as El Nino) and land (soil moisture) covariates are found to be predictive, whereas atmospheric covariates are not considered helpful.",with demonstrated improvements from careful architectural choices With further improvements DL models present a great potential topic for future research We find that ML models tend to select co variate s from the land and ocean such as soil moisture and El Ni o indices and rarely select atmospheric co variate s such as 500 mb geo potential height or other indicators of the atmospheric general circulation Organization of the paper We start with a review of related work in Section 2 Section 3 provides a formal description of the specific S SF problem targeted in this paper and demonstrates the difficulty of sub seasonal climate forecasting for ML techniques Next we briefly discuss ML 2 a Sources of Predictability b MIC c Results of FN N and CNN Figure 1 a Sources of predictability at different forecast time scales Atmosphere is most predictive at weather time scales whereas for S SF land and ocean are considered important sources of predictability 49 b Maximum information coefficient MIC 40 between temperature of week 3 4 and week 2 1 Small MIC s 0 1 at a majority of locations indicate little information shared between the most recent date and the forecasting target c Predictive skills of Fully connected Neural Networks FN N and Convolutional Neural Networks CNN in terms of temporal cosine similarity see definition in Section 5 for temperature prediction over 2017 2018 Positive values closer to 1 green indicate better predictive skills approaches we plan to investigate Section 4 followed by details on data and experimental setup Section 5 Subsequently Section 6 3 presents experimental results comparing the predictive skills over 10 ML models including several DL models Finally we conclude in Section 7,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Recent progress in quantum algorithms and hardware indicates the potential importance of quantum computing in the near future. However, finding suitable application areas remains an active area of research. Quantum machine learning is touted as a potential approach to demonstrate quantum advantage within both the gate-model and the adiabatic schemes. For instance, the Quantum-assisted Variational Autoencoder has been proposed as a quantum enhancement to the discrete VAE. We extend on previous work and study the real-world applicability of a QVAE by presenting a proof-of-concept for similarity search in large-scale high-dimensional datasets. While exact and fast similarity search algorithms are available for low dimensional datasets, scaling to high-dimensional data is non-trivial. We show how to construct a space-efficient search index based on the latent space representation of a QVAE. Our experiments show a correlation between the Hamming distance in the embedded space and the Euclidean distance in the original space on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. Further, we find real-world speedups compared to linear search and demonstrate memory-efficient scaling to half a billion data points.",from our QVAE QVAE linear search and linear search We executed all experiments on a computer with 36 CPU cores and 384 GB of RAM When reporting timings or speedup we loaded the complete data set into the main memory to remove hard drive ac ces s from wall time measurements We used aD Wave 2000 Q quan tum anneal er and simulated the sampling with Quantum Monte Carlo 45 The dimensions of the two hidden layers found in the encoder and decoder have been fixed to 128 and 64 We fixed the latent size to 64 by picking the latent size out of 32 64 and 128 with highest speed upon the RB M model at are call of 0 8 4 1 Data set The proposed approach has been evaluated for the problem of detecting similarities of land cover vegetation over multiple years using the MOD IS data set on the Terra satellite 46 Terra is a polar orbiting satellite that covers the entire globe once per day at approximately 10 30 am capturing 36 spectral bands at a 250 m 2 km spatial resolution In this work we used the MOD IS Terra 16 day 500 meter vegetation indices MOD 13 A 1 006 from January 2016 to December 2018 47 69 time steps Each MODI Stile covers a region of 1200 km by 1200 km with 2400 by 2400 pixels Six variables were selected Normalized Vegetation Index ND VI Enhanced Vegetation Index EVI red reflectance 0 645 m near infra red reflectance 0 858 m blue reflectance 0 469 m and middle infra red reflectance 2 13 m We ignored all pixels with missing data If not otherwise stated we used the tiles from the rectangular region covering North America h 08 v 04 to h 12 v 06 After filtering 45 386 870 data points remained with 414 dimensions 4 2 Embedded Proximity The quality of approximation of the Hamming distance in the com pressed space to the Euclidean distance in the original space is ll aceR Recall by of the data set viewed k 10 k 100 k 1000 k 10000 Figure 4 Recall value by the of the data set has been plotted for different k Large recall values are preferred The box ex tends to the lower and upper quart ile values of the data the black line within represents the median the whiskers show the range of the data and outliers are marked as circles crucial to the functionality of our search To validate this as sump tion we trained a model with an RB M prior and performed k ANN S as described in Section 3 2 with different percentages of the data set as stopping criterion The search results were then compared to the k best results retrieved by linear search We chose different k for comparison and took 200 samples and report statistics on recall This experiment should show that for a given fraction c max of the n data set retrieving items in order of their Hamming distance results insignificantly larger recall values than randomly selecting items which has an expected recall of c max n Figure 4 presents the results with c max in logarithmic stepson n the x axis and recall on they axis It can be seen that by iterating in order of the Hamming distance we only need to compare against a small fraction of the data set to retrieve most of the nearest neigh bor s While there are error bars ranging from recall 0 to 1 for small percentages of the data set increasing the search radius increases the recall to 1 and reduces errors significantly We also found the search parameter k having little impact on the recall or search time so k was set to 100 for the remaining experiments 4 3 Transverse Field As discussed in Section 2 3 increasing the transverse field increases quantum fluctuations and narrows the learned distribution In the context of ANN S this yields a hash function that maps to fewer distinct bit strings m In Section 3 2 we highlighted the trade off between the query s speed and quality w r t m In this experiment we measured the effect of the transverse field in two ways 1 the number of bit strings m and 2 the speedup at a fixed recall of 0 8 We decided on using the simulated QB M for this experiment for better reproducibility as there are many sources of noise in near term quantum devices which we discuss further in section 5 Additionally at the time of writing this work the performance of,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Understanding subjectivity demands reasoning skills beyond the realm of common knowledge. It requires a machine learning model to process sentiment and to perform opinion mining. In this work, I've exploited a recently released dataset for span-selection Question Answering, namely SubjQA. SubjQA is the first QA dataset that contains questions that ask for subjective opinions corresponding to review paragraphs from six different domains. Hence, to answer these subjective questions, a learner must extract opinions and process sentiment for various domains, and additionally, align the knowledge extracted from a paragraph with the natural language utterances in the corresponding question, which together enhance the difficulty of a QA task. The primary goal of this thesis was to investigate the inner workings (i.e., latent representations) of a Transformer-based architecture to contribute to a better understanding of these not yet well understood ""black-box"" models. Transformer's hidden representations, concerning the true answer span, are clustered more closely in vector space than those representations corresponding to erroneous predictions. This observation holds across the top three Transformer layers for both objective and subjective questions and generally increases as a function of layer dimensions. Moreover, the probability to achieve a high cosine similarity among hidden representations in latent space concerning the true answer span tokens is significantly higher for correct compared to incorrect answer span predictions. These results have decisive implications for down-stream applications, where it is crucial to know about why a neural network made mistakes, and in which point, in space and time the mistake has happened (e.g., to automatically predict correctness of an answer span prediction without the necessity of labeled data).",concerning all conducted experiments will be presented ex plaine d and discussed Note that a thorough interpretation of the results will follow in the Discussion part and hence interpretation is constrained in this section Ad hoc elaboration on results maybe provided but I refer the interested reader to the Discussion section for in depth interpretations Numeric results must be connected to visualization s of models feature representations in vector space in order to understand the breakthroughs and shortcomings of Machine Learning ML models Hence an in depth Qualitative Analysis of the hidden representations with respect to selected neural architectures follows the depiction of quantitative results Alongside this I provide an error analysis to identify the issues the models faced at inference time Here I will try to answer where along the way and why a learner made mistakes Last but not least I will discuss the results obtained from both types of analyses draw conclusions and close with a concise Summary of the the sisto provide a synopsis free of the hefty details,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Google app market captures the school of thought of users via ratings and text reviews. The critique's viewpoint regarding an app is proportional to their satisfaction level.

Sentiment analysis, by machine learning algorithms employing NLP, is used to explicitly uncover and interpret the emotions.

"I develop Macroeconomic Random Forest (MRF), an algorithm adapting the canonical Machine Learning (ML) tool to flexibly model evolving parameters in a linear macro equation.

The approach delivers clear forecasting gains over numerous alternatives, predicts the 2008 drastic rise in unemployment, and performs well for inflation. Unlike most ML-based methods, MRF is directly interpretable -- via its GTVPs. For instance, the successful unemployment forecast is due to the influence of forward-looking variables (e.g., term spreads, housing starts) nearly doubling before every recession. Interestingly, the Phillips curve has indeed flattened, and its might is highly cyclical.",In simulations the tool does comparably well to traditional nonlinear time series models when the data generating process D GP matches what the latter is designed for When the time variation structure becomes out of reach for classical approaches MR F wins Addition ally it supplants plain RF whenever persistence is pervasive In a forecasting application the MR Fs gains are present for almost all variables and horizons under study a rarity for nonlinear forecasting approaches For instance the Auto regressive Random Forest ARR F almost always supplant its resilient OL S counterpart Also an MR F where the linear part is a compact factor augmented auto regression generates very accurate forecasts of the 2008 downturn for both GDP and the unemployment rate UR Inspection of resulting GTV Ps reveals they behave differently from random walk TV Ps For instance in the UR equation the contribution of forward looking variables nearly doubles before every recession including 2008 where the associated is t forecasted to do so out of sample This reinforces the view that financial indicators and other market based expectations proxies can rapidly capture downside risks around business cycle turning points Adrian et al 2019 MR F learned and applied it to great success Inflation is subject to a variety of time variations detection of which would be compromised by approaches lacking the generality of MR F The long run mean and the persistence evolved slowly and in an exogenous fashion this has been repeatedly found in the literature e g Cog ley and Sargent 2001 More novel is the finding that the real activity factor s effect on the price level depends positively on the strength of well known leading indicators especially housing related Following this lead I complete the analysis by looking at a traditional Phillips curve specification I report that the inflation unemployment trade off coefficient decreased sign if i cant ly since the 1980 s and also varies strongly along the business cycle Among other things it is extremely weak following every recession This nuances current evidence on the flatten ing Phillips curve which by design focused almost entirely on long run exogenous change Blanchard et al 2015 Gal and Gam b etti 2019 Del Negro et al 2020 Overall MR F suggests inflation can rise from a positive unemployment gap but it goes down much more timidly from economic slack These findings are made possible by combining different tools within the new framework such as credible intervals for the GTV Ps new variable importance measures spec if ic ally designed forM RF and surrogate trees as interpretative devices for t OUTLINE Section 2 introduces MR F motivates its use considers practical aspects and discusses relationships with available alternatives Sections 3 and 4 report simulations and forecasting results respectively Section 5 analyzes various GTV Ps of interest Section 6 concludes,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Systolic arrays are a promising computing concept which is in particular inline with CMOS technology trends and linear algebra operations found in the processing of artificial neural networks. The recent success of such deep learning methods in a wide set of applications has led to a variety of models, which albeit conceptual similar as based on convolutions and fully-connected layers, in detail show a huge diversity in operations due to a large design space: An operand's dimension varies substantially since it depends on design principles such as receptive field size, number of features, striding, dilating and grouping of features. Last, recent networks extent previously plain feedforward models by various connectivity, such as in ResNet or DenseNet. The problem of choosing an optimal systolic array configuration cannot be solved analytically, thus instead methods and tools are required that facilitate a fast and accurate reasoning about optimality in terms of total cycles, utilization, and amount of data movements. In this work we introduce Camuy, a lightweight model of a weight-stationary systolic array for linear algebra operations that allows quick explorations of different configurations, such as systolic array dimensions and input/output bitwidths. Camuy aids accelerator designers in either finding optimal configurations for a particular network architecture or for robust performance across a variety of network architectures. It offers simple integration into existing machine learning tool stacks (e.g TensorFlow) through custom operators. We present an analysis of popular DNN models to illustrate how it can estimate required cycles, data movement costs, as well as systolic array utilization, and show how the progress in network architecture design impacts the efficiency of inference on accelerators based on systolic arrays.",from these various CNN models for systolic array config u rations of varying height and width and focus in this work on data movement costs This choice is based on the importance of energy efficiency that data movements are orders of magnitude more energy consuming than arithmetic op e rations 6 1 and that systolic arrays are in particular suitable to minimize data movements As can be seen in Figure 4 all models are more sensitive to increasing the systolic array s width than the height indicating that an optimal array config u ration is not quadratic Comparing residual with dense connections one can observe that residual ones favor larger array sizes while dense connections benefit from smaller arrays Furthermore dense connections seems to be rather una f fec ted by varying height while width matters much more Contrary residual connections are equally sensitive to height and width Similar applies to models with group convolutions where smaller arrays are clearly more beneficial Last all but models with group convolution show an advantage if the width is a power of two at least while for group convolutions no such effect is visible For models such as AlexNet GoogleNet BN Inception VGG-16 and ResNet 152 a similar effect on the height is apparent The overall observation is that the inference of almost all analyzed CNN mod els is significantly more efficient for small systolic arrays and especially for arrays with a low width to height ratio This finding is in contrast to the commercially available T PU whose systolic array is quadratic with an edge length of 256 and furthermore conflict ive with the need for parallel iz ation as main technique to further reduce processing time,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Bitcoin is the first digital decentralized cryptocurrency that has shown a significant increase in market capitalization in recent years. The objective of this paper is to determine the predictable price direction of Bitcoin in USD by machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis.

We have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the extracted tweets from Twitter and Reddit posts, and we analyze the correlation between bitcoin price movements and sentiments in tweets. We explored several algorithms of machine learning using supervised learning to develop a prediction model and provide informative analysis of future market prices. Due to the difficulty of evaluating the exact nature of a Time Series(ARIMA) model, it is often very difficult to produce appropriate forecasts. Then we continue to implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with long short-term memory cells (LSTM). Thus, we analyzed the time series model prediction of bitcoin prices with greater efficiency using long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques and compared the predictability of bitcoin price and sentiment analysis of bitcoin tweets to the standard method (ARIMA). The RMSE (Root-mean-square error) of LSTM are 198.448 (single feature) and 197.515 (multi-feature) whereas the ARIMA model RMSE is 209.263 which shows that LSTM with multi feature shows the more accurate result.",with those obtained using auto regressive integrated moving average ARIMA models From 10 a comparison between multi layer perce ptr on MLP and non linear auto regressive exogenous N ARX model is made They conclude that MLP can also be used for stock market prediction even though it does not outperform the N ARX model in price prediction The authors made use of MAT LAB s neural network toolbox to build and evaluate the performance of the network Another paper 11 deals with daily time series data 10 minute and 10 second time interval data They have created three time series data sets for 30 60 and 120 minutes followed by performing GL M random forest on the datasets which produce three linear models These three models are linearly combined to predict the price of bitcoin According to 12 the author is analyzing what has been done to predict the U S stock market the conclusion of his work is the mean square error of the prediction network was as large as the standard deviation of the excess return However the author is providing evidence that several basic financial and economic factors have predictive power for the market excess return In 13 instead of directly forecasting the future price of the stock the authors predict the trend of the stock The trend can be considered as a pattern They perform both short term predictions day or week predictions and also long term predictions months they found that the latter produced better results with 79 accuracy Another interesting approach the paper reflects is the performance evaluation criteria of the network Based on the predicted output the performance evaluation algorithm decides to either buy and sell or hold the stock In this paper we explored some of the relevant methods of bitcoin sentiment prediction using tweets and Reddit posts and our approach is parametric and stems from a hypothetical modeling system based on station ari ty and mixing,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"A set is an unordered collection of unique elements--and yet many machine learning models that generate sets impose an implicit or explicit ordering. Since model performance can depend on the choice of order, any particular ordering can lead to sub-optimal results.

"Transformers are one of the most important machine learning workloads today. Training one is a very compute-intensive task, often taking days or weeks, and significant attention has been given to optimizing transformers. Despite this, existing implementations do not efficiently utilize GPUs. We find that data movement is the key bottleneck when training. Due to Amdahl's Law and massive improvements in compute performance, training has now become memory-bound. Further, existing frameworks use suboptimal data layouts. Using these insights, we present a recipe for globally optimizing data movement in transformers. We reduce data movement by up to 22.91% and overall achieve a 1.30x performance improvement over state-of-the-art frameworks when training a BERT encoder layer and 1.19x for the entire BERT. Our approach is applicable more broadly to optimizing deep neural networks, and offers insight into how to tackle emerging performance bottlenecks.",A significant portion of the runtime in existing

"Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a fundamental model used in machine learning. Owing to its accurate prediction with uncertainty and versatility in handling various data structures via kernels, GPR has been successfully used in various applications. However, in GPR, how the features of an input contribute to its prediction cannot be interpreted. Herein, we propose GPR with local explanation, which reveals the feature contributions to the prediction of each sample, while maintaining the predictive performance of GPR. In the proposed model, both the prediction and explanation for each sample are performed using an easy-to-interpret locally linear model. The weight vector of the locally linear model is assumed to be generated from multivariate Gaussian process priors. The hyperparameters of the proposed models are estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood. For a new test sample, the proposed model can predict the values of its target variable and weight vector, as well as their uncertainties, in a closed form. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets verify that the proposed model can achieve predictive performance comparable to those of GPR and superior to that of existing interpretable models, and can achieve higher interpretability than them, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",Accuracy First we demonstrate the predictive performances of G PX and the comparing methods in Table 1 G PX achieved the lowest predictive errors on all the datasets compared to the other globally or locally linear models In addition their predictive errors were comparable to that of G PRon all the datasets This result indicates that GP R can be replaced by G PX to achieve similar predictive performances Faithfulness Assessing the correctness of the estimated contribution of each feature to a prediction requires a reference true contribution for comparison As this is rarely available a typical approach for measuring the faithfulness of the contributions produced by interpret able models is to rely on the proxy notion of the contributions observing the effect of removing features on the model s prediction Following previous studies Melis and J a akko la 2018 Bhatt et al 2020 we computed the faithfulness score by removing features one by one measuring the differences between the original predictions and the predictions from the inputs without the removed features and calculating the correlation between the differences and the contributions of the removed features Table 2 shows the faithfulness scores of G PX and the comparing methods Here we denote the results of LIME and Kernel SHAP using GP Ras the black box prediction model by GP R LIME and GP R SHAP respectively We found that G PX achieved the best faithfulness scores on all the datasets As G PX predicts and explains using a single locally linear model for each test sample when removing a feature from the input the contribution of the feature is subtracted from the prediction directly Meanwhile because GP R LIME GP R SHAP and KL have different prediction and explanation models a gap may exist between the estimated contribution in the explanation model and the latent contribution in the prediction Because the predictions by G PX and GP R were performed using similar calculations,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Distributional data Shapley value (DShapley) has recently been proposed as a principled framework to quantify the contribution of individual datum in machine learning. DShapley develops the foundational game theory concept of Shapley values into a statistical framework and can be applied to identify data points that are useful (or harmful) to a learning algorithm. Estimating DShapley is computationally expensive, however, and this can be a major challenge to using it in practice. Moreover, there has been little mathematical analyses of how this value depends on data characteristics. In this paper, we derive the first analytic expressions for DShapley for the canonical problems of linear regression, binary classification, and non-parametric density estimation. These analytic forms provide new algorithms to estimate DShapley that are several orders of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our formulas are directly interpretable and provide quantitative insights into how the value varies for different types of data.

"Coded computation techniques provide robustness against straggling workers in distributed computing. However, most of the existing schemes require exact provisioning of the straggling behaviour and ignore the computations carried out by straggling workers. Moreover, these schemes are typically designed to recover the desired computation results accurately, while in many machine learning and iterative optimization algorithms, faster approximate solutions are known to result in an improvement in the overall convergence time. In this paper, we first introduce a novel coded matrix-vector multiplication scheme, called coded computation with partial recovery (CCPR), which benefits from the advantages of both coded and uncoded computation schemes, and reduces both the computation time and the decoding complexity by allowing a trade-off between the accuracy and the speed of computation. We then extend this approach to distributed implementation of more general computation tasks by proposing a coded communication scheme with partial recovery, where the results of subtasks computed by the workers are coded before being communicated. Numerical simulations on a large linear regression task confirm the benefits of the proposed distributed computation scheme with partial recovery in terms of the trade-off between the computation accuracy and latency.",from against straggling workers in distributed computing However all the workers the PS combines them to obtain the result most of the existing schemes require exact provisioning of the of the main computation task In principle such a distributed straggling behavior and ignore the computations carried out computation framework should achieve a speed up factor pro by straggling workers Moreover these schemes are typically designed to recover the desired computation results accurately portion alto the number of workers employed However in real while in many machine learning and iterative optimization implementations the overall computation time is constrained algorithms faster approximate solutions are known to result in by the slowest so called straggling worker s Moreover as an improvement in the overall convergence time In this paper the number of employed workers increases communication we first introduce a novel coded matrix vector multiplication starts to become more complex and to introduce additional scheme called coded computation with partial recovery CCPR which benefits from the advantages of both coded and un coded delays which can aggravate the straggler problem To rem computation schemes and reduces both the computation time ed y the delays due to straggling workers various straggler and the decoding complexity by allowing a trade off between tolerant distributed computation schemes have been introduced the accuracy and the speed of computation We then extend recently which build upon the idea of assigning redundant this approach to distributed implementation of more general computations sub tasks to workers to let faster workers com computation tasks by proposing a coded communication scheme with partial recovery where the results of sub tasks computed by pens ate for the stragglers 1 42 the workers are coded before being communicated Numerical simulations on a large Linear Regression task confirm the benefits A Motivation of the proposed scheme in terms of the trade off between the computation accuracy and latency We will motivate the proposed distributed computation framework on a simple regression problem In linear re gres Index Terms Coded computation distributed computation maximum distance separable MDS code linear codes rate less sion the goal is to minimize the empirical mean squared error codes stragglers cid 44 2 1 x 2 1,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"In the current era, an increasing number of machine learning models is generated for the automation of industrial processes. To that end, machine learning models are trained using historical data of each single asset leading to the development of asset-based models. To elevate machine learning models to a higher level of learning capability, domain adaptation has opened the door for extracting relevant patterns from several assets combined together. In this research we are focusing on translating the specific asset-based historical data (source domain) into data corresponding to one reference asset (target domain), leading to the creation of a multi-assets global dataset required for training domain invariant generic machine learning models. This research is conducted to apply domain adaptation to the ironmaking industry, and particularly for the creation of a domain invariant dataset by gathering data from different blast furnaces. The blast furnace data is characterized by multivariate time series. Domain adaptation for multivariate time series data hasn't been covered extensively in the literature.

"Forecasting the formation and development of clouds is a central element of modern weather forecasting systems. Incorrect clouds forecasts can lead to major uncertainty in the overall accuracy of weather forecasts due to their intrinsic role in the Earth's climate system. Few studies have tackled this challenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of high-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this paper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It consists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of the atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the dataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3x3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between frames for the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31. All frames are centered and projected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation study with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as convolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks, and optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video prediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the spatial and temporal domain.

However, many problems are posed in non-Euclidean domains modeled as general graphs with complex connection patterns. Increased problem complexity and computational power constraints have limited early approaches to static and small-sized graphs. In recent years, a rising interest in machine learning on graph-structured data has been accompanied by improved methods that overcome the limitations of their predecessors. These methods paved the way for dealing with large-scale and time-dynamic graphs. This work aims to provide an overview of early and modern graph neural network based machine learning methods for node-level prediction tasks. Under the umbrella of taxonomies already established in the literature, we explain the core concepts and provide detailed explanations for convolutional methods that have had strong impact. In addition, we introduce common benchmarks and present selected applications from various areas. Finally, we discuss open problems for further research.",Con vG NN See Figure 3 for a demonstration PinS age Yin get al 2018 describe a large scale graph convolution As illustrated in the last section GNNs have shown great per for network for recommending pins in P Interest The model generates man ce for prediction tasks in medicine physics and social sciences hidden embedding s for all nodes pins given their relation to other However GNNs still pose open research questions nodes and input images Figure 4 describes the process of generating Over smoothing There is experimental evidence Lie tal 2018 embedding s The embedding s are then used for recommendation that the performance of GNNs is inversely proportional to the purposes using simple nearest neighbor queries as shown in Fig Stacking depth At present time shallow networks work better ure 5 than deeply stacked networks Che net al 2019 Kip fan dWelling Drug Side Effects Zit nik et al 2018 propose a Con vG NN to 2017 argue that the performance drop can be explained by an over predict poly pharmacy side effects based on drug and protein in smoothing effect inherent to GNNs This issue is reminiscent of ter action Simultaneous use of multiple drugs increases the risk of contraction mapping issues of Rec GNNs The contraction mapping Seminar in Data Science 19 2019 Linz Austria Christoph He in dl forces nearby nodes to create embedding s with decreasing distance This leads to indistinguishable representations of nodes in different classes and impedes the performance of aGNN S cal ability Con vG NN s exploit local neighborhood graph in form a tion to generate node embedding s In each layer information can propagate one hop further around the graph topology Because of the over smoothing issue we cannot stack an arbitrary number of layers and still remain disc rim i native Inescapably information can not propagate throughout the entire graph and is lost The global filters of Spectral Con vG NN s are not exposed to this issue but due to the ei gen decomposition they are limited to moderate graph sizes He t erogenous Graphs Many GNNsa reapplied to homogenous graphs He t erogenous graphs may consist of node types with vary ing semantics e g factor graphs and it is still unclear how to handle those For this reason a practitioner in the field of GNNs will find it hard to choose a template for modelling a specific graph related Figure 5 PinS age recommendation compared to other al problem gor it hms Given an input image left PinS age recommends multiple images based on nearest neighbor queries on hid den embedding s created by a Con vG NN Image taken from 9 CONCLUSION Yin get al 2018 In this work we introduced Graph Neural Networks GNNs to tackle problems in which graph structures are the natural way to represent data In particular we focused on Convolutional Graph Neural Networks Con vG NN We motivated these by the inspiring properties of Convolutions in the Euclidean domain We showed that GNNS are capable of addressing many important machine learning problems in a wide variety of domains such as medicine physics and social sciences We also find that the success of GNNs is strongly linked to the modeling of the input graph In contrast to the Euclidean domain where the graph structure is often implicit e g grid like in images the graph structure in the non Euclidean domain is often designed manually This holds opportunities and risks for the success of a Figure 6 The poly pharmacy graph models protein protein GNN and partly explains why many different solutions for similar drug protein and drug drug interactions The network tasks are proposed takes the former two as given and predicts edge level out put information for drug drug interactions interpreted as the probability of side effects Image taken from Zit nike tal 2018 Figure 7 Left roads with traffic sensor locations super im posed Right adj ace n cy matrix of more than 200 road traffic sensors Graph Neural Networks for Node Level Predictions Seminar in Data Science 19 2019 Linz Austria,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Machine learning on tiny IoT devices based on microcontroller units (MCU) is appealing but challenging: the memory of microcontrollers is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller even than mobile phones. We propose MCUNet, a framework that jointly designs the efficient neural architecture (TinyNAS) and the lightweight inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on microcontrollers. TinyNAS adopts a two-stage neural architecture search approach that first optimizes the search space to fit the resource constraints, then specializes the network architecture in the optimized search space. TinyNAS can automatically handle diverse constraints (i.e.device, latency, energy, memory) under low search costs.TinyNAS is co-designed with TinyEngine, a memory-efficient inference library to expand the search space and fit a larger model. TinyEngine adapts the memory scheduling according to the overall network topology rather than layer-wise optimization, reducing the memory usage by 4.8x, and accelerating the inference by 1.7-3.3x compared to TF-Lite Micro and CMSIS-NN. MCUNet is the first to achieves >70% ImageNet top1 accuracy on an off-the-shelf commercial microcontroller, using 3.5x less SRAM and 5.7x less Flash compared to quantized MobileNetV2 and ResNet-18. On visual&audio wake words tasks, MCUNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and runs 2.4-3.4x faster than MobileNetV2 and ProxylessNAS-based solutions with 3.7-4.1x smaller peak SRAM. Our study suggests that the era of always-on tiny machine learning on IoT devices has arrived.

"Sorted Table Search Procedures are the quintessential query-answering tool, with widespread usage that now includes also Web Applications, e.g, Search Engines (Google Chrome) and ad Bidding Systems (AppNexus). Speeding them up, at very little cost in space, is still a quite significant achievement. Here we study to what extend Machine Learning Techniques can contribute to obtain such a speed-up via a systematic experimental comparison of known efficient implementations of Sorted Table Search procedures, with different Data Layouts, and their Learned counterparts developed here. We characterize the scenarios in which those latter can be profitably used with respect to the former, accounting for both CPU and GPU computing. Our approach contributes also to the study of Learned Data Structures, a recent proposal to improve the time/space performance of fundamental Data Structures, e.g., B-trees, Hash Tables, Bloom Filters.

"In this paper, a joint task, spectrum, and transmit power allocation problem is investigated for a wireless network in which the base stations (BSs) are equipped with mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to jointly provide computational and communication services to users. Each user can request one computational task from three types of computational tasks. Since the data size of each computational task is different, as the requested computational task varies, the BSs must adjust their resource (subcarrier and transmit power) and task allocation schemes to effectively serve the users. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the maximal computational and transmission delay among all users. A multi-stack reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Using the proposed algorithm, each BS can record the historical resource allocation schemes and users' information in its multiple stacks to avoid learning the same resource allocation scheme and users' states, thus improving the convergence speed and learning efficiency. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence and the maximal delay among all users by up to 18% and 11.1% compared to the standard Q-learning algorithm.",illustrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence and the maximal delay among all users by up to 18 and 11 1 compared to the standard Q-Learning algorithm Index Terms Mobile edge computing resource management multi stack reinforcement learning S Wang X Liu and C Yin are with the Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Network and the Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing 100876 China Email si hua wang b up t edu cn x uanl in liu b up t edu cn cc yin ieee org M Chen is with the Department of Electrical Engineering Princeton University Princeton NJ 08544 USA and also with the Chinese University of Hong Kong Shenzhen 518172 China Email ming zhe c princeton edu S Cui is with the Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data and Future Network of Intelligence Institute FN ii the Chinese University of Hong Kong Shenzhen 518172 China Email shu guang cui cu hk edu cn H V Poor is with the Department of Electrical Engineering Princeton University Princeton NJ 08544 USA Email poor princeton edu,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hyperparameters play a critical role in the performances of many machine learning methods. Determining their best settings or Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) faces difficulties presented by the large number of hyperparameters as well as the excessive training time. In this paper, we develop an effective approach to reducing the total amount of required training time for HPO. In the initialization, the nested Latin hypercube design is used to select hyperparameter configurations for two types of training, which are, respectively, heavy training and light training. We propose a truncated additive Gaussian process model to calibrate approximate performance measurements generated by light training, using accurate performance measurements generated by heavy training. Based on the model, a sequential model-based algorithm is developed to generate the performance profile of the configuration space as well as find optimal ones.

"Over the past few years, the automatic generation of facial animation for virtual characters has garnered interest among the animation research and industry communities. Recent research contributions leverage machine-learning approaches to enable impressive capabilities at generating plausible facial animation from audio and/or video signals. However, these approaches do not address the problem of animation edition, meaning the need for correcting an unsatisfactory baseline animation or modifying the animation content itself. In facial animation pipelines, the process of editing an existing animation is just as important and time-consuming as producing a baseline. In this work, we propose a new learning-based approach to easily edit a facial animation from a set of intuitive control parameters. To cope with high-frequency components in facial movements and preserve a temporal coherency in the animation, we use a resolution-preserving fully convolutional neural network that maps control parameters to blendshapes coefficients sequences. We stack an additional resolution-preserving animation autoencoder after the regressor to ensure that the system outputs natural-looking animation. The proposed system is robust and can handle coarse, exaggerated edits from non-specialist users. It also retains the high-frequency motion of the facial animation.",error MSE between the input and the output blend shapes weights In this section we present experimental results of our facial anim a

"Machine learning applied to generate data-driven models are lacking of transparency leading the process engineer to lose confidence in relying on the model predictions to optimize his industrial process. Bringing processes in the industry to a certain level of autonomy using data-driven models is particularly challenging as the first user of those models, is the expert in the process with often decades of experience. It is necessary to expose to the process engineer, not solely the model predictions, but also their interpretability. To that end, several approaches have been proposed in the literature. The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method has gained a lot of interest from the research community recently. The principle of this method is to train a linear model that is locally approximating the black-box model, by generating randomly artificial data points locally. Model-agnostic local interpretability solutions based on LIME have recently emerged to improve the original method. We present in this paper a novel approach, VAE-LIME, for local interpretability of data-driven models forecasting the temperature of the hot metal produced by a blast furnace. Such ironmaking process data is characterized by multivariate time series with high inter-correlation representing the underlying process in a blast furnace. Our contribution is to use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn the complex blast furnace process characteristics from the data. The VAE is aiming at generating optimal artificial samples to train a local interpretable model better representing the black-box model in the neighborhood of the input sample processed by the black-box model to make a prediction. In comparison with LIME, VAE-LIME is showing a significantly improved local fidelity of the local interpretable linear model with the black-box model resulting in robust model interpretability.",Lacking a justification for the black box data driven model in this paper a novel approach VAE LIME for local prediction is leading the domain expert to be unable to understand

selection of the algorithm to train the data driven latent space exhibits properties like spatial continuity allowing a black box model Indeed there exists intrinsic explain able meaningful reconstruction of any random point located in that algorithm like Cart 6 or Linear Regression but they are lacking of space The distance between points in the latent space is related to predictive

"How to accurately classify and diagnose whether an individual has Coronary Stenosis (CS) without invasive physical examination? This problem has not been solved satisfactorily. To this end, the four machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., Boosted Tree (BT), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) are employed in this paper. First, eleven features including basic information of an individual, symptoms and results of routine physical examination are selected, as well as one label is specified, indicating whether an individual suffers from different severity of coronary artery stenosis or not. On the basis of it, a sample set is constructed. Second, each of these four ML algorithms learns from the sample set to obtain the corresponding optimal classified results, respectively. The experimental results show that: RF performs better than other three algorithms, and the former algorithm classifies whether an individual has CS with an accuracy of 95.7% (=90/94).",of routine physical examination are selected as well Thus we are looking for away to assist in the CS diagnosis as one label is specified indicating whether an individual suffers in safety and screen of coronary heart disease as well as from different severity of coronary artery stenosis or not On control the false negative rate to a certain range considering the basis of it a sample set is constructed Second each of these four ML algorithms learns from the sample set to obtain that a false negative diagnosis is more dangerous than a false the corresponding optimal classified results respectively The positive one Can an A I algorithm be used to do something experimental results show that RF performs better than other for this We need an A I based method With this method we three algorithms and the former algorithm classifies whether an input the data including the basic information of an individual individual has CS with an accuracy of 95 7 90 94 routine physical examination and symptoms and the A I Index Terms coronary stenosis coronary artery disease ma based method can intelligently and automatically analyze these chin e learning random forest classification intelligent diagnosis data so that the relationship between these raw data and the diagnosis conclusion made by coronary angiography are obtained In this way the result of coronary angiography can,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Complex devices are connected daily and eagerly generate vast streams of multidimensional state measurements. These devices often operate in distinct modes based on external conditions (day/night, occupied/vacant, etc.), and to prevent complete or partial system outage, we would like to recognize as early as possible when these devices begin to operate outside the normal modes. Unfortunately, it is often impractical or impossible to predict failures using rules or supervised machine learning, because failure modes are too complex, devices are too new to adequately characterize in a specific environment, or environmental change puts the device into an unpredictable condition. We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that creates a negative sample from the positive, observed sample, and trains a classifier to distinguish between positive and negative samples. Using the Contraction Principle, we explain why such a classifier ought to establish suitable decision boundaries between normal and anomalous regions, and show how Integrated Gradients can attribute the anomaly to specific variables within the anomalous state vector. We have demonstrated that negative sampling with random forest or neural network classifiers yield significantly higher AUC scores than Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and Deep SVDD, against (a) a synthetic dataset with dimensionality ranging between 2 and 128, with 1, 2, and 3 modes, and with and without noise dimensions; (b) four standard benchmark datasets; and (c) a multidimensional, multimodal dataset from real climate control devices.

"Few-shot classification (FSC), the task of adapting a classifier to unseen classes given a small labeled dataset, is an important step on the path toward human-like machine learning. Bayesian methods are well-suited to tackling the fundamental issue of overfitting in the few-shot scenario because they allow practitioners to specify prior beliefs and update those beliefs in light of observed data. Contemporary approaches to Bayesian few-shot classification maintain a posterior distribution over model parameters, which is slow and requires storage that scales with model size. Instead, we propose a Gaussian process classifier based on a novel combination of P\'olya-Gamma augmentation and the one-vs-each softmax approximation that allows us to efficiently marginalize over functions rather than model parameters. We demonstrate improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification on both standard few-shot classification benchmarks and few-shot domain transfer tasks.",are averaged over 200 randomly generated splits for each training set size 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 examples per class Error bars indicate 95 confidence intervals detection In order to empirically compare methods we could not simply borrow the accuracy results from other papers but instead needed to train each of these baselines ourselves For all baselines except Bayesian MAM L AB ML and Logistic Soft max GP we ran the code from Pata c chi ola et al 2020 and verified that the ac curacies matched closely to their reported results Additional experimental details maybe found in Section B We have made Py Torch code for our experiments publicly available 2 5 3 Few shot Classification Baselines The baselines we compared to are explained here in more detail Feature Transfer Che net al 2019 involves first training an off line class i fier on the training classes and then training a new classification layer on the episode Baseline Che net al 2019 is similar to Feature Transfer except it uses a cosine distance module prior to the soft max during fine tuning Matching Networks Vi nya lse tal 2016 can be viewed as a soft form of k nearest neighbors that computes attention and sums over the support examples to form a predictive distribution over classes Prototypical Networks Snell et al 2017 computes class means prototypes and forms a predictive distribution based on Euclidean distance to the prototypes It can be viewed as a Gaussian class i fier operating in an embedding space MAM L Finn et al 2017 performs one or a few steps of gradient descent on the support set and then makes predictions on the query set back propagating through the gradient descent pro ce dure For this baseline we simply quote the classification accuracy reported by Pata c chi ola et al 2020 Relation Net Sun get al 2018 rather than using a predefined distance metric as in Matching Networks or Prototypical Networks instead learns a deep distance metric as the output of a 2 https g it hub com jake snell ove polya gamma gp,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) have recently generated considerable interest for constructing computationally efficient counterparts of nonlinear dynamical systems emerging from various domain sciences. They provide a low-dimensional emulation framework for systems that may be intrinsically high-dimensional. This is accomplished by utilizing a construction algorithm that is purely data-driven. It is no surprise, therefore, that the algorithmic advances of machine learning have led to non-intrusive ROMs with greater accuracy and computational gains. However, in bypassing the utilization of an equation-based evolution, it is often seen that the interpretability of the ROM framework suffers. This becomes more problematic when black-box deep learning methods are used which are notorious for lacking robustness outside the physical regime of the observed data. In this article, we propose the use of a novel latent-space interpolation algorithm based on Gaussian process regression. Notably, this reduced-order evolution of the system is parameterized by control parameters to allow for interpolation in space. The use of this procedure also allows for a continuous interpretation of time which allows for temporal interpolation. The latter aspect provides information, with quantified uncertainty, about full-state evolution at a finer resolution than that utilized for training the ROMs. We assess the viability of this algorithm for an advection-dominated system given by the inviscid shallow water equations.",in a representation of the original data along with a model the POD bases or decoder s to reconstruct the data for any point in the latent space We then only require a temporal interpolation scheme fitted on the representation space so that a time evolution of the dyna m ical system can be reconstructed as schematically shown in Fig 1 In our approach we deploy the use of GPs 48 as our interpolation algorithm While GPs perform Bayesian regression tasks with a high level of interpret a bil ty they are generally computationally expensive for large data sizes We achieve a considerable reduction of computational cost by fitting in the space of reduced dimensions In addition the GP R may also be restricted to a less noisy space compared with the original data set of the dynamical evolution A GP is an accumulation of random variables every finite collection of which follows a multivariate Gaussian d is tri but ion It can be perceived as a generalization of a multivariate Gaussian distribution with infinite space GPs are a popular choice for non Linear Regression 49 due to their flexibility and ease of use In addition one of their main advantages is that they incorporate a principled way of measuring the uncertainty information since they provide predictions in distribution al form For the purpose of this paper aGP R model is used to fit the reduced space from the data compression algorithms of Section 3 Subsequently the mean prediction which corresponds to the maximum a posterior i MAP estimate is used for the reconstructions We use the GP flow library for the experiments 50 A GP can be completely specified by its second order statistics Thus a mean function m x equal to zero can be assumed and a positive definite co variance function kernel k x x cid 48 which can be perceived as a measure of similarity between x and x cid 48 is the only requirement to specify the GP,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect phishing emails is primarily dependent on large-scale centralized datasets, which opens it up to a myriad of privacy, trust, and legal issues. Moreover, organizations are loathed to share emails, given the risk of leakage of commercially sensitive information. So, it is uncommon to obtain sufficient emails to train a global AI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and collaborative machine learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), is a desideratum. Already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain regarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within the context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge, the work herein is the first to investigate the use of FL in email anti-phishing. This paper builds upon a deep neural network model, particularly RNN and BERT for phishing email detection. It analyzes the FL-entangled learning performance under various settings, including balanced and asymmetrical data distribution. Our results corroborate comparable performance statistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for balanced datasets, and low organization counts. Moreover, we observe a variation in performance when increasing organizational counts. For a fixed total email dataset, the global RNN based model suffers by a 1.8% accuracy drop when increasing organizational counts from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT accuracy rises by 0.6% when going from 2 to 5 organizations. However, if we allow increasing the overall email dataset with the introduction of new organizations in the FL framework, the organizational level performance is improved by achieving a faster convergence speed. Besides, FL suffers in its overall global model performance due to highly unstable outputs if the email dataset distribution is highly asymmetric.",and future work for phishing detection has been explored for a long time Conventional ML based techniques such as decision trees This paper is the first step in federated email learning for Logistic Regression random forests AdaBoost and support phishing detection Though our results demonstrated its ben vector machines are analyzed in phishing detection 8 40 ef its and performances FL needs more studies specifically 45 These techniques are based on feature engineering for its robustness under aspects such as security attacks which requires in depth domain knowledge and trials On 6 1 Improving federated learning per for the other hand DL based methods include deep neural net man ce in phishing email detection works 46 convolutional neural networks CNN s 5 deep belief networks 47 bidirectional LSTM with supervised This paper considered the federated averaging Fed Avg attention 48 and recurrent convolutional neural networks algorithm for the model aggregation in FL But in literature 6 These works are mostly based on natural language it is reported that Fed Avg can have a hugely detrimental processing techniques for phishing detection While most effect on the model s performance because there can be existing works have focused on the effective detection of many variants of the model weights that only differ in the general phishing emails few works consider specialized ordering of parameters such as in neural networks 57 phishing attacks including spear phishing attacks 49 and Besides the personalization of the model may cause the business email compromise attacks 50 in specific contexts deterioration of the model performance due to the Fed Avg Despite the usefulness all the above works operate under 58 Personalization means that the local model may fit,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"The concept of learned index structures relies on the idea that the input-output functionality of a database index can be viewed as a prediction task and, thus, be implemented using a machine learning model instead of traditional algorithmic techniques. This novel angle for a decades-old problem has inspired numerous exciting results in the intersection of machine learning and data structures. However, the main advantage of learned index structures, i.e., the ability to adjust to the data at hand via the underlying ML-model, can become a disadvantage from a security perspective as it could be exploited. In this work, we present the first study of poisoning attacks on learned index structures. The required poisoning approach is different from all previous works since the model under attack is trained on a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and, thus, every injection on the training set has a cascading impact on multiple data values. We formulate the first poisoning attacks on linear regression models trained on the CDF, which is a basic building block of the proposed learned index structures. We generalize our poisoning techniques to attack a more advanced two-stage design of learned index structures called recursive model index (RMI), which has been shown to outperform traditional B-Trees. We evaluate our attacks on real-world and synthetic datasets under a wide variety of parameterizations of the model and show that the error of the RMI increases up to $300\times$ and the error of its second-stage models increases up to $3000\times$.",The results of our evaluation a represented in Figure 4 For a fixed number of legitimate keys and a fixed key density i e focusing on a single plot of Figure 4 a we see that the higher 4 4 Greedy Multiple Point Poisoning on CD F the poisoning percentage the larger the ratio loss and the average We generalize the single point approach so as to insert multiple memory offset For instance in the large key domains we see that poisoning keys Specifically we propose a greedy approach where the ratio increases up to 100 as the poisoning percentage gets at each iteration the attacker makes a locally optimal decision and larger On the other hand we also observe that when the density is inserts the poisoning key that maximizes the error of the augmented too high it may result in a much smaller error increase in both me a key set so far see Algorithm 1 Eventhough we do not provide a sure ment s Another interesting observation from our experiments proof of optimal it y for the multiple point poisoning we ex peri is that lower density for the same fixed number of legitimate keys mentally observed that our approach matched the performance implies a larger set of potential poisoning keys and thus allows of the brute force attack in every tested data set Intuitively our for a greater increase of error This can be seen from the drop of,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Recently, large scale Transformer-based language models such as BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet have brought about exciting leaps in state-of-the-art results for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One of the common trends in these recent models is a significant increase in model complexity, which introduces both more weights and computation. Moreover, with the advent of large-scale unsupervised datasets, training time is further extended due to the increased amount of data samples within a single training epoch. As a result, to train these models within a reasonable time, machine learning (ML) programmers often require advanced hardware setups such as the premium GPU-enabled NVIDIA DGX workstations or specialized accelerators such as Google's TPU Pods. Our work addresses this limitation and demonstrates that the BERT pre-trained model can be trained within 2 weeks on an academic-size cluster of widely available GPUs through careful algorithmic and software optimizations. In this paper, we present these optimizations on how to improve single device training throughput, distribute the training workload over multiple nodes and GPUs, and overcome the communication bottleneck introduced by the large data exchanges over the network. We show that we are able to perform pre-training on BERT within a reasonable time budget (12 days) in an academic setting, but with a much less expensive and less aggressive hardware resource requirement than in previously demonstrated industrial settings based on NVIDIA DGX machines or Google's TPU Pods.",We describe our performance improvements for the different layers of optimization s below 5 1 Single GPU Optimization For the single kernel optimization Table 4 and 5 summarize the throughput gain of using FP 16 and kernel fusion Using FP 16 improves the throughput by 1 7 on NVIDIA P 100 and 2 5 on NVIDIA 2080 Ti Furthermore FP 16 is more effective on GPUs equipped with Tensor Cores as the cores are enabled only by FP 16 operations Kernel fusion further enhances the single GPU throughput by around 1 2 for all three devices Since these optimization techniques can be applied separately the combination of both produces a final speedup of atleast 2 05 on NVIDIA P 100 2 78 on NVIDIA T 4 and 3 05 on NVIDIA 2080 Ti Table 4 Throughput Comparison Tokens s Device Non Optimized FP 16 FP 16 Fused Kernel Seq Length P 100 41 1576 3 2680 7 3228 8 128 T 4 Tensor Core 17 1953 5 4430 9 5429 1 128 2080 Ti Tensor Core 42 3527 2 8823 8 10765 8 128 Table 5 Throughput Speedups using non optimized baseline Device Non Optimized FP 16 FP 16 Fused Kernel P 100 41 1 1 7 2 05 T 4 Tensor Core 17 1 2 27 2 78 2080 Ti Tensor Core 42 1 2 5 3 05 5 2 Multi Node Optimization We trained BERT large with 32 machine nodes each equipped with 8 NVIDIA T 4 GPUs 17 This amounts to 256 GPUs in total We applied gradient accumulation for 4 steps to reduce network traffic Individual GPU workers sum up the gradients from 4 different mini batches before exchanging and updating the model parameter among all the workers Combining the reduction of network traffic from performing gradient accumulation with our optimization work on single GPU we are able to achieve a weak scaling factor of 165 times with 10 Gbp s network bandwidth As we show in Figure 6 the scaling efficiency decreases as we continue to increase the number of machines as communication and synchronization overhead dominates the training time Figure 7 shows the loss curves of two phase training and table 8 listed the differences in training configurations for our two phase pre training We had some convergence issues in phase 2 as figure 7 illustrates the training loss plateaus after one epoch of training and starting from the second epoch loss spikes up at the very end of each epoch and decreases later In phase 1 the loss value at the end of last epoch is about 1 2 In phase 2 the average loss value in the final epoch is around 1 3 5 3 Pre training and Fine tuning Results We evaluated our pre training models through fine tuning our pre trained model on SQuAD v 1 1 data set using the same fine tuning configurations as 1 did Our model achieved 81 to 83 F 1 scores depending on the loaded pre trained checkpoints Compared with Google s 90 9 1 and NVIDIA s 11 90 to 91 there is a discrepancy of 9 10,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Volunteer computing uses Internet-connected devices (laptops, PCs, smart devices, etc.), in which their owners volunteer them as storage and computing power resources, has become an essential mechanism for resource management in numerous applications.

"In a low-dimensional linear regression setup, considering linear transformations/combinations of predictors does not alter predictions. However, when the forecasting technology either uses shrinkage or is nonlinear, it does. This is precisely the fabric of the machine learning (ML) macroeconomic forecasting environment. Pre-processing of the data translates to an alteration of the regularization -- explicit or implicit -- embedded in ML algorithms. We review old transformations and propose new ones, then empirically evaluate their merits in a substantial pseudo-out-sample exercise. It is found that traditional factors should almost always be included as predictors and moving average rotations of the data can provide important gains for various forecasting targets. Also, we note that while predicting directly the average growth rate is equivalent to averaging separate horizon forecasts when using OLS-based techniques, the latter can substantially improve on the former when regularization and/or nonparametric nonlinearities are involved.",can be summarized as follows First combining non standard data transform a t ions MARX MA F and Level minimizes the RMS E for 8 and 9 variables out of 10 when re spec t iv ely predicting at short horizons 1 and 3 month ahead They remain resilient at longer horizons as they are part of best RMS E specifications around 80 of time Second their contribution is magnified when combined with nonlinear ML models 38 out of 47 cases 2 with an advantage for Random Forests over Boosted Trees Both algorithms allow for nonlinear i ties via tree base learners and make heavy use of shrinkage via Ensemble averaging This is precisely the al go ri th mic environment we conjectured could benefit most from non standard transformations of X Third traditional factors can help tremendously The overwhelming majority of best information sets for each target included factors On that regard this amounts to a clear take away message while ML methods can handle the high dimensional X both computationally and statistically extracting common factors remains straightforward feature engineering that pays off Fourth the path average approach is preferred to the direct counterpart for almost all real activity var i able s and at most horizons Combined with high dimensional methods that use some form of regular iz ation improves predictability by as much as 30 The rest of the paper is organized as follows In section 2 we present the ML predictive framework and detail the data transformations and forecasting models In section 3 we detail the forecasting experiment and in section 4 we present main results Section 5 concludes,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"An advanced conceptual validation framework for multimodal multivariate time series defines a multi-level contextual anomaly detection ranging from an univariate context definition, to a multimodal abstract context representation learnt by an Autoencoder from heterogeneous data (images, time series, sounds, etc.) associated to an industrial process. Each level of the framework is either applicable to historical data and/or live data. The ultimate level is based on causal discovery to identify causal relations in observational data in order to exclude biased data to train machine learning models and provide means to the domain expert to discover unknown causal relations in the underlying process represented by the data sample. A Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder is successfully evaluated on multivariate time series to validate the learnt representation of abstract contexts associated to multiple assets of a blast furnace.

"In the electronic health record, using clinical notes to identify entities such as disorders and their temporality (e.g. the order of an event relative to a time index) can inform many important analyses. However, creating training data for clinical entity tasks is time consuming and sharing labeled data is challenging due to privacy concerns. The information needs of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for agile methods of training machine learning models for clinical notes. We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies and expert-generated rules. Our approach, unlike hand-labeled notes, is easy to share and modify, while offering performance comparable to learning from manually labeled training data. In this work, we validate our framework on six benchmark tasks and demonstrate Trove's ability to analyze the records of patients visiting the emergency department at Stanford Health Care for COVID-19 presenting symptoms and risk factors.",Experiment overview After quantifying the performance of ontology driven weak supervision in all our tasks we performed four experiments First we examined performance differences by label source abl at ions which compared ontology based labeling functions against those incorporating task specific rules Second we compared Trove to existing weakly supervised tagging methods Third we examined learning source ac curacies for UML S terminologies Finally we report on a case study that used Trove to monitor emergency department notes for symptoms and risk factors associated with patients tested for C OVID 19 We evaluated four methods of combining labeling functions to train entity class if i ers 1 Majority vote MV is the majority class for each word predicted by all labeling functions In cases of abstain or ties predictions default to the majority class 2 Label model LM is the default data programming model Abstain and ties default to the majority class 3 Weakly Supervised WS is Bio BERT trained on the probabilistic data set generated by the label model 4 Fully supervised FS is Bio BERT trained on the original expert labeled training set tuned to match current published state of the art performance and using the validation set for early stopping,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"The authors compared oversampling methods for the problem of multi-class topic classification. The SMOTE algorithm underlies one of the most popular oversampling methods. It consists in choosing two examples of a minority class and generating a new example based on them. In the paper, the authors compared the basic SMOTE method with its two modifications (Borderline SMOTE and ADASYN) and random oversampling technique on the example of one of text classification tasks. The paper discusses the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, the support vector machine algorithm and three types of neural networks (feedforward network, long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM). The authors combine these machine learning algorithms with different text representations and compared synthetic oversampling methods. In most cases, the use of oversampling techniques can significantly improve the quality of classification. The authors conclude that for this task, the quality of the KNN and SVM algorithms is more influenced by class imbalance than neural networks.",Thus the KNN algorithm makes a decision regarding a new object based on the classes of its nearest neighbors The lack of the nearest neighbors leads to the fact that the algorithm often assigns a new object to the majority class The SVM algorithm constructs a hyper plane to classify vectors in a high dimensional space The optimal marginal data for the hyper plane is known as support vectors The algorithm tries to find the optimal hyper plane that would maximize distance between the margins The training sample vectors are used in the construction of the separating hyper plane 8 Accordingly the influence of imbalance should be also significant but probably not as decisive as in the case of the KNN algorithm Neural networks area set of algorithms based on neural models representing an interconnected group of artificial neurons It can be expected that the meth od s of calculating errors in the training of neural networks can reduce the impact of imbalance in comparison with previous algorithms Despite this research in this area shows that the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental The minority class examples can be identified by neural network as noise and therefore they could be wrongly discarded by the class i fier 9 10 We consider three types of neural networks The first one is feed forward network which is the classic architecture for neural models The feed forward network can accept a numerical vector as input and allows using all over sam p ling methods for input vectors Recurrent networks are currently showing some of the best results in the field of natural language text classification Earlier we compared various types of neural networks for multi class classification of bio graphical text fragments 11 The best results were achieved using LSTM and BLSTM networks 3 2 Text Representation We used the following ways of text representation Bag of Words Bag of Words T F IDF Word 2 Vec The Bag of Words model represents a text collection as a matrix The number of rows in the matrix is equal to the number of texts and the number of columns is equal to the number of words in the collection except for the list of stop words,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and computer vision tools have enabled applications in a wide variety of arenas such as financial analytics, medical diagnostics, and even within the Department of Defense. However, their widespread implementation in real-world use cases poses several challenges: (1) many applications are highly specialized, and hence operate in a \emph{sparse data} domain; (2) ML tools are sensitive to their training sets and typically require cumbersome, labor-intensive data collection and data labelling processes; and (3) ML tools can be extremely ""black box,"" offering users little to no insight into the decision-making process or how new data might affect prediction performance. To address these challenges, we have designed and developed Data Augmentation from Proficient Pre-Training of Robust Generative Adversarial Networks (DAPPER GAN), an ML analytics support tool that automatically generates novel views of training images in order to improve downstream classifier performance. DAPPER GAN leverages high-fidelity embeddings generated by a StyleGAN2 model (trained on the LSUN cars dataset) to create novel imagery for previously unseen classes. We experimentally evaluate this technique on the Stanford Cars dataset, demonstrating improved vehicle make and model classification accuracy and reduced requirements for real data using our GAN based data augmentation framework. The method's validity was supported through an analysis of classifier performance on both augmented and non-augmented datasets, achieving comparable or better accuracy with up to 30\% less real data across visually similar classes.

"Idiomatic expressions can be problematic for natural language processing applications as their meaning cannot be inferred from their constituting words.

"Systems exhibiting nonlinear dynamics, including but not limited to chaos, are ubiquitous across Earth Sciences such as Meteorology, Hydrology, Climate and Ecology, as well as Biology such as neural and cardiac processes. However, System Identification remains a challenge. In climate and earth systems models, while governing equations follow from first principles and understanding of key processes has steadily improved, the largest uncertainties are often caused by parameterizations such as cloud physics, which in turn have witnessed limited improvements over the last several decades. Climate scientists have pointed to Machine Learning enhanced parameter estimation as a possible solution, with proof-of-concept methodological adaptations being examined on idealized systems.

"Vehicle acceleration and deceleration maneuvers at traffic signals results in significant fuel and energy consumption levels.

significant operational challenge From a vehicle standpoint consistent stop and go at traffic maneuvers at signals leads to more acceleration and deceleration resulting in higher fuel consumption and lower energy efficiency From a network perspective consistent stop and go induces shockwaves E te if a Ra kha Eldar d iry 2 propagating through the network that reduce roadway capacity 1 This leads to significant delays incurred by the network users as well as safety concerns due to aggressive acceleration and deceleration and uncertainty associated with traffic signals 2 Alleviating this problem has two main sides The first is optimizing the logic and adaptability of the traffic signal controllers to introduce operations that can minimize the number of stops This can allow the progression of traffic flow across the network This problem has been tackled by multiple researchers but it is a complex task and involves significant investments by the infrastructure operators The other side is controlling the vehicle speeds to allow them to progress through signals when they are green and thus reduce the probability of having to stop A lot of previous work investigated the Green light optimal speed advisory GLOSA and different control systems to minimize stop and go operation and maximize fuel efficiency 3 4 The underlying assumption for these systems however is that there is a reliable estimate of the switching times of upcoming traffic signals Moreover having a reliable estimate of the signal switching time can provide the drivers less uncertainty alleviating the issues of dilemma zone and improving safety at intersections It is also crucial for automated and connected vehicles to make more informed decisions when approaching intersections for more stable and fuel efficient operation Optimizing traffic signal controller logic and providing drivers with optimal speed advice are two conflicting objectives The reason behind that is that the more adaptive a traffic control system is to changes in traffic conditions the less predictable it is in terms of switching times In other words actuated traffic signals would provide more time to a given movement if the detectors are being actuated Therefore deducing the amount of green time left for a particular movement would entail knowledge of the exact pattern at which detectors will be actuated over time These act u at ions are very stochastic in nature and are difficult to predict making estimation of the remaining time for a signal to switch a very challenging process Problem Statement Existing traffic signal controllers are very flexible in terms of accommodating different road users and allocating varying times to different movements This high flexibility gives rise to very low predictability of the controller where the more flexible the controller is to accommodate different traffic conditions the less predictable its timing is The complexity of predicting the traffic signal state can be attributed to two factors The first is the controller logic where the D 4 controller logic is highly adaptable and allows for different ways to adapt to the incoming traffic Examples of this adaptability include options like having floating green times that can be allocated to different movements allowing all settings to vary according to time of day allowing locked calls for vehicles or

"In the big data era, deep learning and intelligent data mining technique solutions have been applied by researchers in various areas. Forecast and analysis of stock market data have represented an essential role in today's economy, and a significant challenge to the specialist since the market's tendencies are immensely complex, chaotic and are developed within a highly dynamic environment. There are numerous researches from multiple areas intending to take on that challenge, and Machine Learning approaches have been the focus of many of them. There are multiple models of Machine Learning algorithms been able to obtain competent outcomes doing that class of foresight. This paper proposes the implementation of a generative adversarial network (GAN), which is composed by a bi-directional Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network(CNN) referred as Bi-LSTM-CNN to generate synthetic data that agree with existing real financial data so the features of stocks with positive or negative trends can be retained to predict future trends of a stock. The novelty of this proposed solution that distinct from previous solutions is that this paper introduced the concept of a hybrid system (Bi-LSTM-CNN) rather than a sole LSTM model. It was collected data from multiple stock markets such as TSX, SHCOMP, KOSPI 200 and the S&P 500, proposing an adaptative-hybrid system for trends prediction on stock market prices, and carried a comprehensive evaluation on several commonly utilized machine learning prototypes, and it is concluded that the proposed solution approach outperforms preceding models.

"As interest in applying machine learning techniques for medical images continues to grow at a rapid pace, models are starting to be developed and deployed for clinical applications. In the clinical AI model development lifecycle (described by Lu et al. [1]), a crucial phase for machine learning scientists and clinicians is the proper design and collection of the data cohort. The ability to recognize various forms of biases and distribution shifts in the dataset is critical at this step. While it remains difficult to account for all potential sources of bias, techniques can be developed to identify specific types of bias in order to mitigate their impact. In this work we analyze how the distribution of scanner manufacturers in a dataset can contribute to the overall bias of deep learning models. We evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for both classification and segmentation tasks, specifically two state-of-the-art models: ResNet [2] for classification and U-Net [3] for segmentation. We demonstrate that CNNs can learn to distinguish the imaging scanner manufacturer and that this bias can substantially impact model performance for both classification and segmentation tasks. By creating an original synthesis dataset of brain data mimicking the presence of more or less subtle lesions we also show that this bias is related to the difficulty of the task. Recognition of such bias is critical to develop robust, generalizable models that will be crucial for clinical applications in real-world data distributions.",described in Section 4 3 3 3 Segmentation Model Architecture A 3 D variant of the state of the art U-Net architecture was used to quantify bias in a segmentation task using the Skull data set The model architecture consisted of five compression stages with 8 16 32 64 128 channels respectively followed by the decompression stages that mirror them Each stage is formed by two convolutional layers with kernel size of 3 in each dimension followed by a pooling layer of dimension 2 The final layer uses a s igm oid activation function and outputs the predicted mask corresponding to the input series The network was trained using the Dice loss 13 and Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1 x 10 4 The model takes as input the NCC T volume of dimension 256 256 32 The same normalization process as in the classification experiments was used Experimental Settings After training 5 models with Skull for hyper parameter optimization we observed that high Dice scores above 0 96 were consistently easy to achieve We then trained on Skull GE and Skull Si using the same approach implemented to analyze the classification task A total of 20 models were trained to obtain the results described in Section 4,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"MUSE is a novel slide-free imaging technique for histological examination of tissues that can serve as an alternative to traditional histology. In order to bridge the gap between MUSE and traditional histology, we aim to convert MUSE images to resemble authentic hematoxylin- and eosin-stained (H&E) images. We evaluated four models: a non-machine-learning-based color-mapping unmixing-based tool, CycleGAN, DualGAN, and GANILLA. CycleGAN and GANILLA provided visually compelling results that appropriately transferred H&E style and preserved MUSE content. Based on training an automated critic on real and generated H&E images, we determined that CycleGAN demonstrated the best performance. We have also found that MUSE color inversion may be a necessary step for accurate modality conversion to H&E.

"Logistic Regression (LR) is the most widely used machine learning model in industry for its efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. Due to the problem of data isolation and the requirement of high model performance, many applications in industry call for building a secure and efficient LR model for multiple parties. Most existing work uses either Homomorphic Encryption (HE) or Secret Sharing (SS) to build secure LR. HE based methods can deal with high-dimensional sparse features, but they incur potential security risks. SS based methods have provable security, but they have efficiency issue under high-dimensional sparse features. In this paper, we first present CAESAR, which combines HE and SS to build secure large-scale sparse logistic regression model and achieves both efficiency and security. We then present the distributed implementation of CAESAR for scalability requirement. We have deployed CAESAR in a risk control task and conducted comprehensive experiments.

"There is a growing need for empirical benchmarks that support researchers and practitioners in selecting the best machine learning technique for given prediction tasks. In this paper, we consider the next event prediction task in business process predictive monitoring and we extend our previously published benchmark by studying the impact on the performance of different encoding windows and of using ensemble schemes. The choice of whether to use ensembles and which scheme to use often depends on the type of data and classification task. While there is a general understanding that ensembles perform well in predictive monitoring of business processes, next event prediction is a task for which no other benchmarks involving ensembles are available. The proposed benchmark helps researchers to select a high performing individual classifier or ensemble scheme given the variability at the case level of the event log under consideration. Experimental results show that choosing an optimal number of events for feature encoding is challenging, resulting in the need to consider each event log individually when selecting an optimal value. Ensemble schemes improve the performance of low performing classifiers in this task, such as SVM, whereas high performing classifiers, such as tree-based classifiers, are not better off when ensemble schemes are considered.",This paper extends a benchmark previously published by the authors 57 regarding the next event prediction task in business process monitoring by considering the effect of increasing the window size for encoding features and benchmarking the performance of 12 individual classification algorithms and 6 Ensemble schemes The benchmark has identified a set of high performing tree based class if i ers the performance of which improves only slightly when considered in Ensembles as opposed to being used as individual class if i ers Moreover the benchmark highlights that Ensemble schemes improve accuracy only in the case of low performing class if i ers such as SVM Regarding the size of the window considered for encoding features this benchmark did not obtain conclusive evidence Generally we suggest to assess the optimal window size for each event log while we also highlight that lower window sizes e g l 3 as consistently considered previously in the literature strike a good balance between performance and availability of samples for training and testing The proposed benchmark fills a gap in the literature related with providing informed guidelines about how to select a high performing machine learning model forgiven prediction tasks in business process predictive monitoring Future work will concern extending this type of benchmark to different prediction tasks such as outcome based process prediction or prediction of remaining times in process execution The benchmark can also be extended by considering other approaches for classification based on neural networks Also the runtime performance of different class if i ers will be benchmarked which is particularly useful when choosing a class i fier in scenarios in which ACM Trans In tell Syst Techno l Vol 1 No 1 Article 1 Publication date January 2020 An empirical investigation of different class if i ers encoding and Ensemble schemes for next event prediction using business process event logs 1 25 predictions are supposed to be made in near real time to support pro active decision making scenarios,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Over 30% of the ~4000 known exoplanets to date have been discovered using 'validation', where the statistical likelihood of a transit arising from a false positive (FP), non-planetary scenario is calculated. For the large majority of these validated planets calculations were performed using the vespa algorithm (Morton et al. 2016). Regardless of the strengths and weaknesses of vespa, it is highly desirable for the catalogue of known planets not to be dependent on a single method. We demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically a gaussian process classifier (GPC) reinforced by other models, to perform probabilistic planet validation incorporating prior probabilities for possible FP scenarios. The GPC can attain a mean log-loss per sample of 0.54 when separating confirmed planets from FPs in the Kepler threshold crossing event (TCE) catalogue. Our models can validate thousands of unseen candidates in seconds once applicable vetting metrics are calculated, and can be adapted to work with the active TESS mission, where the large number of observed targets necessitates the use of automated algorithms. We discuss the limitations and caveats of this methodology, and after accounting for possible failure modes newly validate 50 Kepler candidates as planets, sanity checking the validations by confirming them with vespa using up to date stellar information. Concerning discrepancies with vespa arise for many other candidates, which typically resolve in favour of our models.

"Gaussian processes regression models are an appealing machine learning method as they learn expressive non-linear models from exemplar data with minimal parameter tuning and estimate both the mean and covariance of unseen points. However, exponential computational complexity growth with the number of training samples has been a long standing challenge. During training, one has to compute and invert an $N \times N$ kernel matrix at every iteration. Regression requires computation of an $m \times N$ kernel where $N$ and $m$ are the number of training and test points respectively. In this work we show how approximating the covariance kernel using eigenvalues and functions leads to an approximate Gaussian process with significant reduction in training and regression complexity. Training with the proposed approach requires computing only a $N \times n$ eigenfunction matrix and a $n \times n$ inverse where $n$ is a selected number of eigenvalues. Furthermore, regression now only requires an $m \times n$ matrix. Finally, in a special case the hyperparameter optimization is completely independent form the number of training samples. The proposed method can regress over multiple outputs, estimate the derivative of the regressor of any order, and learn the correlations between them. The computational complexity reduction, regression capabilities, and multioutput correlation learning are demonstrated in simulation examples.",over the test region when assuming independent outputs K I and using the learned correlation matrix clearly f M Fig 9 FAM GP regression over strongly correlated outputs In the test demonstrating the benefits of the multivariate GP extension region yellow noisy samples of Y 1 are available whileY 2 is entr i ely Table 3 compares the regression accuracy of FAM GP and missing as explained in figure 8 Left Uncorrelated output assumption regular GP for training and test data regions Using 75 Kf I 2 When the outputs are assumed uncorrelated even though eigenvalues and functions to estimate a squared exponential Y 1 is available for regression in the test region it is not utilized in estimation of Y 2 and the estimate drops to the zero mean assumption kernel of length 0 1 is accurate to 99 99 and thus the Right Using Kf learned from the training region Due to the correlation results between FAM GP and regular GP are almost identical between outputs FAM GP can utilize theY 1 samples in estimating Y 2 However the training regression and storage requirements and maintain regression accuracy of FAM GP are magnitudes less than that of regular GP For this example at each training iteration FAM GP computes the 1333 75 X matrix and evaluates a 150 150 inverse samples and eigenvalues respectively In the multi output regular G P calculates the full 1333 1333 k ern el and the case complexity is reduced from MN 3 to Mn 3 O O inverse of a 2666 2666 matrix T he proposed approach where Mis the number of outputs The proposed approach not only allows for fast training and estimation but also and regular GP took 45 and 441 seconds respectively to provides any order analytic derivatives of the GP We complete the required 926 gradient descent iterations for provide the eigenvalues and functions of three different parameter convergence After training FAM GP needs to only save the 150 element vector and 150 150 G matrix kernels squared exponential periodic and Chebyshev and while GP needs the full 2666 2666 kernel inverse Finally show that in special cases hyper parameter optimization can be completely independent from the number of training for mean regression over the test set FAM GP computes a,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Software testing is one of the important ways to ensure the quality of software. It is found that testing cost more than 50% of overall project cost. Effective and efficient software testing utilizes the minimum resources of software. Therefore, it is important to construct the procedure which is not only able to perform the efficient testing but also minimizes the utilization of project resources. The goal of software testing is to find maximum defects in the software system. More the defects found in the software ensure more efficiency is the software testing Different techniques have been proposed to detect the defects in software and to utilize the resources and achieve good results. As world is continuously moving toward data driven approach for making important decision. Therefore, in this research paper we performed the machine learning analysis on the publicly available datasets and tried to achieve the maximum accuracy. The major focus of the paper is to apply different machine learning techniques on the datasets and find out which technique produce efficient result. Particularly, we proposed an ensemble learning models and perform comparative analysis among KNN, Decision tree, SVM and Na\""ive Bayes on different datasets and it is demonstrated that performance of Ensemble method is more than other methods in term of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

"Highly regulated domains such as finance have long favoured the use of machine learning algorithms that are scalable, transparent, robust and yield better performance. One of the most prominent examples of such an algorithm is XGBoost. Meanwhile, there is also a growing interest in building fair and unbiased models in these regulated domains and numerous bias-mitigation algorithms have been proposed to this end. However, most of these bias-mitigation methods are restricted to specific model families such as logistic regression or support vector machine models, thus leaving modelers with a difficult decision of choosing between fairness from the bias-mitigation algorithms and scalability, transparency, performance from algorithms such as XGBoost. We aim to leverage the best of both worlds by proposing a fair variant of XGBoost that enjoys all the advantages of XGBoost, while also matching the levels of fairness from the state-of-the-art bias-mitigation algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed solution requires very little in terms of changes to the original XGBoost library, thus making it easy for adoption.

"Brief fragments of sleep shorter than 15 s are defined as microsleep episodes (MSEs), often subjectively perceived as sleepiness. Their main characteristic is a slowing in frequency in the electroencephalogram (EEG), similar to stage N1 sleep according to standard criteria. The maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) is often used in a clinical setting to assess vigilance. Scoring of the MWT in most sleep-wake centers is limited to classical definition of sleep (30-s epochs), and MSEs are mostly not considered in the absence of established scoring criteria defining MSEs but also because of the laborious work. We aimed for automatic detection of MSEs with machine learning, i.e. with deep learning based on raw EEG and EOG data as input. We analyzed MWT data of 76 patients. Experts visually scored wakefulness, and according to recently developed scoring criteria MSEs, microsleep episode candidates (MSEc), and episodes of drowsiness (ED). We implemented segmentation algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a combination of a CNN with a long-short term memory (LSTM) network. A LSTM network is a type of a recurrent neural network which has a memory for past events and takes them into account. Data of 53 patients were used for training of the classifiers, 12 for validation and 11 for testing. Our algorithms showed a good performance close to human experts. The detection was very good for wakefulness and MSEs and poor for MSEc and ED, similar to the low inter-expert reliability for these borderline segments. We provide a proof of principle that it is feasible to reliably detect MSEs with deep neuronal networks based on raw EEG and EOG data with a performance close to that of human experts.

"This paper proposes a new framework based on a wavelet transform and deep neural network for identifying noisy Raman spectrum since, in practice, it is relatively difficult to classify the spectrum under baseline noise and additive white Gaussian noise environments. The framework consists of two main engines. Wavelet transform is proposed as the framework front-end for transforming 1-D noise Raman spectrum to two-dimensional data. This two-dimensional data will be fed to the framework back-end which is a classifier. The optimum classifier is chosen by implementing several traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, and then we investigated their classification accuracy and robustness performances. The four MLs we choose included a Naive Bayes (NB), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Random Forest (RF) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) where a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) was chosen for a DL classifier. Noise-free, Gaussian noise, baseline noise, and mixed-noise Raman spectrums were applied to train and validate the ML and DCNN models. The optimum back-end classifier was obtained by testing the ML and DCNN models with several noisy Raman spectrums (10-30 dB noise power). Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the DCNN classifier is 9% higher than the NB classifier, 3.5% higher than the RF classifier, 1% higher than the KNN classifier, and 0.5% higher than the SVM classifier. In terms of robustness to the mixed noise scenarios, the framework with DCNN back-end showed superior performance than the other ML back-ends. The DCNN back-end achieved 90% accuracy at 3 dB SNR while NB, SVM, RF, and K-NN back-ends required 27 dB, 22 dB, 27 dB, and 23 dB SNR, respectively. In addition, in the low-noise test data set, the F-measure score of the DCNN back-end exceeded 99.1% while the F-measure scores of the other ML engines were below 98.7%.",show that compared with NB cells the accuracy of cancer cell image recognition is 89 2 SVM RF and KNN the proposed framework has confirming that the D NN is a powerful image processing better classification accuracy and stronger robustness technology Natalia et al constructed a multi level DL framework the core of which is the unsupervised NN and a II Materials and method group of supervised NN s 24 The accuracy of this particular In this section a new framework based on a WT and a 2 D D NN is 85 compared with a convolution neural network DCNN will be described Fig 1 shows a diagram of the CNN in the classification of land cover and crop types in proposed framework which consists of three stages The first multi band and multi source satellite images stage is data preparation The input of one dimensional Raman In the signal theory aspect the Raman spectrum is a one spectrum will be pre processed by adding noise Noisy Raman dimensional 1 D signal hence 1 DCNN was proposed to data sets were created and grouped into training and test groups identify a spectrum peak from a noisy Raman spectrum M and converted into 2 D scale map data using WT The second Fuku hara et al used a digitally generated Lorentz spectrum to stage is the training of the class i fier The training data set will determine the optimal filter size close to line width and the be applied to a ML and 2 D DCNN algorithm and the class i fier number of filters to extract Raman peaks However this method based on ML and 2 D DCNN will be obtained from this stage has many steps and the extracted peaks were partially missing Finally the noisy Raman data sets with different noise levels are The recognition accuracy of 1 DCNN is very low in a relatively tested with different class if i ers and compared with the large noise environment noise close to the sub peak 25 traditional ML class if i ers At present the primary performance Consequently we propose a Raman spectrum classification of DCNN is based on the research of a two dimensional algorithm based on a two dimensional deep convolution neural class i fier The following content will be explained in detail from network 2 D DCNN WT is proposed to transform 1 D noisy the data set generation wavelet transform and deep neural Raman spectra to a 2 D scape map 19 All spectrum network information and noise information on the noisy Raman spectrum will be retained in the scale graph without loss The 2 A MATERIAL D data in the scale map domain is related to Raman shift and R RUFF is a complete collection of high quality Raman intensity This 2 D DCNN model will be trained with several spectroscopy databases composed of 4051 well defined datasets and subsequently validated with other datasets for minerals 1 Raman spectrometers obtained these Raman testing spectra with laser wavelengths of 532 nm and 780 nm In this Significance of Proposed Work paper we chose the Raman spectrums of Actinolite Al bite In the proposed framework WT and DCNN should overcome Forster it e Gross u lar and Maria lite as the noiseless spectrum the deficiencies of classification Raman spectroscopy in datasets In the R RUFF database there are at most 13 original Raman spectrums of each material In a practical environment,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"This paper contributes to the study of PUFs vulnerability against modeling attacks by evaluating the security of XOR BR PUFs, XOR TBR PUFs, and obfuscated architectures of XOR BR PUF using a simplified mathematical model and deep learning (DL) techniques. Obtained results show that DL modeling attacks could easily break the security of 4-input XOR BR PUFs and 4-input XOR TBR PUFs with modeling accuracy $\sim$ 99%. Similar attacks were executed using single-layer neural networks (NN) and support vector machines (SVM) with polynomial kernel and the obtained results showed that single NNs failed to break the PUF security. Furthermore, SVM results confirmed the same modeling accuracy reported in previous research ($\sim$ 50%). For the first time, this research empirically shows that DL networks can be used as powerful modeling techniques against these complex PUF architectures for which previous conventional machine learning techniques had failed. Furthermore, a detailed scalability analysis is conducted on the DL networks with respect to PUFs' stage size and complexity. The analysis shows that the number of layers and hidden neurons inside every layer has a linear relationship with PUFs' stage size, which agrees with the theoretical findings in deep learning.

"Purpose: Identify and examine the associations between health behaviors and increased risk of adolescent suicide attempts, while controlling for socioeconomic and demographic differences. Design: A data-driven analysis using cross-sectional data. Setting: Communities in the state of Montana from 1999 to 2017. Subjects: Selected 22,447 adolescents of whom 1,631 adolescents attempted suicide at least once. Measures: Overall 29 variables (predictors) accounting for psychological behaviors, illegal substances consumption, daily activities at schools and demographic backgrounds, were considered. Analysis: A library of machine learning algorithms along with the traditionally-used logistic regression were used to model and predict suicide attempt risk. Model performances (goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy) were measured using accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. Results: The non-parametric Bayesian tree ensemble model outperformed all other models, with 80.0% accuracy in goodness-of-fit (F-score:0.802) and 78.2% in predictive accuracy (F-score:0.785). Key health-behaviors identified include: being sad/hopeless, followed by safety concerns at school, physical fighting, inhalant usage, illegal drugs consumption at school, current cigarette usage, and having first sex at an early age (below 15 years of age). Additionally, the minority groups (American Indian/Alaska Natives, Hispanics/Latinos), and females are also found to be highly vulnerable to attempting suicides. Conclusion: Significant contribution of this work is understanding the key health-behaviors and health disparities that lead to higher frequency of suicide attempts among adolescents, while accounting for the non-linearity and complex interactions among the outcome and the exposure variables.",The non parametric Bayesian tree Ensemble model outperformed all other models with 80 0 accuracy in goodness of fit F score 0 802 and 78 2 in predictive accuracy F score 0 785 Key health behaviors identified include being sad hopeless 0 0001 followed by safety concerns at school 0 0001 physical fighting 0 0001 inhalant usage 0 0001 illegal drugs consumption at school 0 0001 current cigarette usage 0 0001 and having first sex at an early age below 15 years of age Additionally the minority groups American Indian Alaska Natives Hispanics Latinos 0 0001 and females 0 0001 are also found to be highly vulnerable to attempting suicides Conclusion Significant contribution of this work is understanding the key health behaviors and health disparities that lead to higher frequency of suicide attempts among adolescents while accounting for the non linearity and complex interactions among the outcome and the exposure variables Findings provide insights on key health behaviors that can be viewed as early warning signs precursors of suicide attempts in adolescents Keywords mental health health behaviors health policy suicide attempts among adolescents suicide prevention predictive analytics,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"General embeddings like word2vec, GloVe and ELMo have shown a lot of success in natural language tasks. The embeddings are typically extracted from models that are built on general tasks such as skip-gram models and natural language generation. In this paper, we extend the work from natural language understanding to multi-modal architectures that use audio, visual and textual information for machine learning tasks.

"The objective of this study is to develop a good risk model for classifying business delinquency by simultaneously exploring several machine learning based methods including regularization, hyper-parameter optimization, and model ensembling algorithms. The rationale under the analyses is firstly to obtain good base binary classifiers (include Logistic Regression ($LR$), K-Nearest Neighbors ($KNN$), Decision Tree ($DT$), and Artificial Neural Networks ($ANN$)) via regularization and appropriate settings of hyper-parameters. Then two model ensembling algorithms including bagging and boosting are performed on the good base classifiers for further model improvement. The models are evaluated using accuracy, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC of ROC), recall, and F1 score via repeating 10-fold cross-validation 10 times. The results show the optimal base classifiers along with the hyper-parameter settings are $LR$ without regularization, $KNN$ by using 9 nearest neighbors, $DT$ by setting the maximum level of the tree to be 7, and $ANN$ with three hidden layers. Bagging on $KNN$ with $K$ valued 9 is the optimal model we can get for risk classification as it reaches the average accuracy, AUC, recall, and F1 score valued 0.90, 0.93, 0.82, and 0.89, respectively.",settings for the base class if i ers are LR without regular iz ation KNN The best base class if i ers along with their hyper parameter setting by using 9 nearest neighbors DT by setting the level of the tree to are LR 0 i e LR without regular iz ation KNN 9 i e K valued 9 be 7 and ANN with three hidden layers The optimal model we get DT 7 i e max depth valued 7 and ANN 4 i e contains three for classifying business delinquency is through Bagging on KNN hidden layers and having units valued 50 25 and 13 respectively with K valued 9 which reaches the average accuracy A UC recall in each layer Figure 1 shows the result of the best class if i ers as and F 1 score valued 0 90 0 93 0 82 and 0 89 respectively Although well as their Ensemble models The post fix bag and boo denote different conclusions maybe obtained because of various data set Bagging and boosting respectively In LR Bagging and boosting used in the future the study methodology provided by us is a good cannot significantly improve the model performance with respect reference for studies that aiming to improve risk modeling using to accuracy recall and F 1 score Quite unexpectedly boosting on machine learning based algorithms LR even hurt the A UC by a large extent InK NN both Bagging and,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Representation learning algorithms automatically learn the features of data. Several representation learning algorithms for graph data, such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and GraphSAGE, sample the graph to produce mini-batches that are suitable for training a DNN. However, sampling time can be a significant fraction of training time, and existing systems do not efficiently parallelize sampling. Sampling is an embarrassingly parallel problem and may appear to lend itself to GPU acceleration, but the irregularity of graphs makes it hard to use GPU resources effectively. This paper presents NextDoor, a system designed to effectively perform graph sampling on GPUs. NextDoor employs a new approach to graph sampling that we call transit-parallelism, which allows load balancing and caching of edges. NextDoor provides end-users with a high-level abstraction for writing a variety of graph sampling algorithms. We implement several graph sampling applications, and show that NextDoor runs them orders of magnitude faster than existing systems.",update their state and can send new messages Graph comp u We

"In recent years, the use of deep learning in language models gained much attention. Some research projects claim that they can generate text that can be interpreted as human-writing, enabling new possibilities in many application areas. Among the different areas related to language processing, one of the most notable in applying this type of modeling is programming languages. For years, the Machine Learning community has been researching this software engineering area, pursuing goals like applying different approaches to auto-complete, generate, fix, or evaluate code programmed by humans. Considering the increasing popularity of the Deep-Learning-enabled language models approach, we detected a lack of empirical papers that compare different deep learning architectures to create and use language models based on programming code. This paper compares different neural network architectures like AWD-LSTMs, AWD-QRNNs, and Transformer while using transfer learning and different tokenizations to see how they behave in building language models using a Python dataset for code generation and filling mask tasks. Considering the results, we discuss each approach's different strengths and weaknesses and what gaps we find to evaluate the language models or apply them in a real programming context.",when creating

"We develop heuristic interpolation methods for the functions $t \mapsto \log \det \left( \mathbf{A} + t \mathbf{B} \right)$ and $t \mapsto \operatorname{trace}\left( (\mathbf{A} + t \mathbf{B})^{p} \right)$ where the matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are Hermitian and positive (semi) definite and $p$ and $t$ are real variables.

"Memes are graphics and text overlapped so that together they present concepts that become dubious if one of them is absent. It is spread mostly on social media platforms, in the form of jokes, sarcasm, motivating, etc. After the success of BERT in Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers inclined to Visual-Linguistic (VL) multimodal problems like memes classification, image captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), and many more. Unfortunately, many memes get uploaded each day on social media platforms that need automatic censoring to curb misinformation and hate. Recently, this issue has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners. State-of-the-art methods that performed significantly on other VL dataset, tends to fail on memes classification. In this context, this work aims to conduct a comprehensive study on memes classification, generally on the VL multimodal problems and cutting edge solutions. We propose a generalized framework for VL problems. We cover the early and next-generation works on VL problems. Finally, we identify and articulate several open research issues and challenges. This is the first study that presents the generalized view of the advanced classification techniques concerning memes classification to the best of our knowledge.

"We introduce a new notion of generalization -- Distributional Generalization -- which roughly states that outputs of a classifier at train and test time are close *as distributions*, as opposed to close in just their average error. For example, if we mislabel 30% of dogs as cats in the train set of CIFAR-10, then a ResNet trained to interpolation will in fact mislabel roughly 30% of dogs as cats on the *test set* as well, while leaving other classes unaffected. This behavior is not captured by classical generalization, which would only consider the average error and not the distribution of errors over the input domain. Our formal conjectures, which are much more general than this example, characterize the form of distributional generalization that can be expected in terms of problem parameters: model architecture, training procedure, number of samples, and data distribution. We give empirical evidence for these conjectures across a variety of domains in machine learning, including neural networks, kernel machines, and decision trees.

"Decisions made by machine learning systems have increasing influence on the world, yet it is common for machine learning algorithms to assume that no such influence exists. An example is the use of the i.i.d. assumption in content recommendation. In fact, the (choice of) content displayed can change users' perceptions and preferences, or even drive them away, causing a shift in the distribution of users. We introduce the term auto-induced distributional shift (ADS) to describe the phenomenon of an algorithm causing a change in the distribution of its own inputs. Our goal is to ensure that machine learning systems do not leverage ADS to increase performance when doing so could be undesirable. We demonstrate that changes to the learning algorithm, such as the introduction of meta-learning, can cause hidden incentives for auto-induced distributional shift (HI-ADS) to be revealed. To address this issue, we introduce `unit tests' and a mitigation strategy for HI-ADS, as well as a toy environment for modelling real-world issues with HI-ADS in content recommendation, where we demonstrate that strong meta-learners achieve gains in performance via ADS.

"Machine learning is widely used in developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes of medical images. However, CAD usually computes large number of image features from the targeted regions, which creates a challenge of how to identify a small and optimal feature vector to build robust machine learning models. In this study, we investigate feasibility of applying a random projection algorithm to build an optimal feature vector from the initially CAD-generated large feature pool and improve performance of machine learning model. We assemble a retrospective dataset involving 1,487 cases of mammograms in which 644 cases have confirmed malignant mass lesions and 843 have benign lesions. A CAD scheme is first applied to segment mass regions and initially compute 181 features. Then, support vector machine (SVM) models embedded with several feature dimensionality reduction methods are built to predict likelihood of lesions being malignant. All SVM models are trained and tested using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method. SVM generates a likelihood score of each segmented mass region depicting on one-view mammogram. By fusion of two scores of the same mass depicting on two-view mammograms, a case-based likelihood score is also evaluated. Comparing with the principle component analyses, nonnegative matrix factorization, and Chi-squared methods, SVM embedded with the random projection algorithm yielded a significantly higher case-based lesion classification performance with the area under ROC curve of 0.84+0.01 (p<0.02). The study demonstrates that the random project algorithm is a promising method to generate optimal feature vectors to help improve performance of machine learning models of medical images.",fixed

"Petrographic analysis based on microfacies identification in thin sections is widely used in sedimentary environment interpretation and paleoecological reconstruction. Fossil recognition from microfacies is an essential procedure for petrographers to complete this task. Distinguishing the morphological and microstructural diversity of skeletal fragments requires extensive prior knowledge of fossil morphotypes in microfacies and long training sessions under the microscope. This requirement engenders certain challenges for sedimentologists and paleontologists, especially novices. However, a machine classifier can help address this challenge. In this study, we collected a microfacies image dataset comprising both public data from 1,149 references and our own materials (including 30,815 images of 22 fossil and abiotic grain groups). We employed a high-performance workstation to implement four classic deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which have proven to be highly efficient in computer vision over the last several years. Our framework uses a transfer learning technique, which reuses the pre-trained parameters that are trained on a larger ImageNet dataset as initialization for the network to achieve high accuracy with low computing costs. We obtained up to 95% of the top one and 99% of the top three test accuracies in the Inception ResNet v2 architecture. The machine classifier exhibited 0.99 precision on minerals, such as dolomite and pyrite. Although it had some difficulty on samples having similar morphologies, such as the bivalve, brachiopod, and ostracod, it nevertheless obtained 0.88 precision. Our machine learning framework demonstrated high accuracy with reproducibility and bias avoidance that was comparable to those of human classifiers. Its application can thus eliminate much of the tedious, manually intensive efforts by human experts conducting routine identification.",4 1 VGG-16 The best performance of VGG-16 reached 0 91 for the

"Nowadays, the continuous improvement and automation of industrial processes has become a key factor in many fields, and in the chemical industry, it is no exception. This translates into a more efficient use of resources, reduced production time, output of higher quality and reduced waste. Given the complexity of today's industrial processes, it becomes infeasible to monitor and optimize them without the use of information technologies and analytics. In recent years, machine learning methods have been used to automate processes and provide decision support. All of this, based on analyzing large amounts of data generated in a continuous manner. In this paper, we present the results of applying machine learning methods during a chemical sulphonation process with the objective of automating the product quality analysis which currently is performed manually. We used data from process parameters to train different models including Random Forest, Neural Network and linear regression in order to predict product quality values.

"The acquisition of massive data on parcel delivery motivates postal operators to foster the development of predictive systems to improve customer service. Predicting delivery times successive to being shipped out of the final depot, referred to as last-mile prediction, deals with complicating factors such as traffic, drivers' behaviors, and weather. This work studies the use of deep learning for solving a real-world case of last-mile parcel delivery time prediction. We present our solution under the IoT paradigm and discuss its feasibility on a cloud-based architecture as a smart city application. We focus on a large-scale parcel dataset provided by Canada Post, covering the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). We utilize an origin-destination (OD) formulation, in which routes are not available, but only the start and end delivery points. We investigate three categories of convolutional-based neural networks and assess their performances on the task. We further demonstrate how our modeling outperforms several baselines, from classical machine learning models to referenced OD solutions. Specifically, we show that a ResNet architecture with 8 residual blocks displays the best trade-off between performance and complexity. We perform a thorough error analysis across the data and visualize the deep features learned to better understand the model behavior, making interesting remarks on data predictability. Our work provides an end-to-end neural pipeline that leverages parcel OD data as well as weather to accurately predict delivery durations.

"Standardized DNN models that have been proved to perform well on machine learning tasks are widely used and often adopted as-is to solve downstream tasks, forming the transfer learning paradigm. However, when serving multiple instances of such DNN models from a cluster of GPU servers, existing techniques to improve GPU utilization such as batching are inapplicable because models often do not share weights due to fine-tuning. We propose NetFuse, a technique of merging multiple DNN models that share the same architecture but have different weights and different inputs. NetFuse is made possible by replacing operations with more general counterparts that allow a set of weights to be associated with only a certain set of inputs. Experiments on ResNet-50, ResNeXt-50, BERT, and XLNet show that NetFuse can speed up DNN inference time up to 3.6x on a NVIDIA V100 GPU, and up to 3.0x on a TITAN Xp GPU when merging 32 model instances, while only using up a small additional amount of GPU memory.",in Py Torch taking approximately 8 GB s which is already half of the V 100 GPU s total memory 16 GB s Additionally the memory used by the sequential baseline is the smallest for all cases because the sequential baseline performs only one model s worth of inference at a time unlike the concurrent baseline and NET FUSE Sequential concurrent hybrid strategy The concurrent baseline generally tends to be faster than the sequential baseline but suffers from memory issues for large numbers of models Naturally one can think of a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of the concurrent and sequential baselines spawn concurrent processes per model as much as the GPU memory allows and make each process run a number of models sequentially For instance instead of creating 32 processes to serve 32 models like the concurrent baseline we can generate 4 processes that run 8 models each Figure 8 shows the inference time of this hybrid approach for running 32 models along with the other baselines and NET FUSE While the concurrent baseline runs out of memory the hybrid approach is able to avoid this issue by spawning less processes As an example we can see in Figure 8 a that the hybrid configurations of spawning 2 4 and 8 processes do not run out of memory At the same time they exhibit shorter inference times than the purely seq ent i al baseline by running multiple models concurrently Nonetheless NET FUSE still outperforms the hybrid baseline by up to 2 5 for ResNeXt 50 and 7 2 for XLNet Note that the hybrid approach may still be susceptible to memory issues depending on the model as can be seen in Figure 8 d even a relatively small number of processes leads to running out of memory for XLNet,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Artificial Intelligence is providing astonishing results, with medicine being one of its favourite playgrounds. In a few decades, computers may be capable of formulating diagnoses and choosing the correct treatment, while robots may perform surgical operations, and conversational agents could interact with patients as virtual coaches. Machine Learning and, in particular, Deep Neural Networks are behind this revolution. In this scenario, important decisions will be controlled by standalone machines that have learned predictive models from provided data. Among the most challenging targets of interest in medicine are cancer diagnosis and therapies but, to start this revolution, software tools need to be adapted to cover the new requirements. In this sense, learning tools are becoming a commodity in Python and Matlab libraries, just to name two, but to exploit all their possibilities, it is essential to fully understand how models are interpreted and which models are more interpretable than others. In this survey, we analyse current machine learning models, frameworks, databases and other related tools as applied to medicine - specifically, to cancer research - and we discuss their interpretability, performance and the necessary input data. From the evidence available, ANN, LR and SVM have been observed to be the preferred models. Besides, CNNs, supported by the rapid development of GPUs and tensor-oriented programming libraries, are gaining in importance. However, the interpretability of results by doctors is rarely considered which is a factor that needs to be improved.

"In the age of digital recruitment, job posts can attract a large number of applications, and screening them manually can become a very tedious task. These recruitment records are stored in the form of tables in our recruitment database (Electronic Recruitment Records, referred to as ERRs). We have released a de-identified ERR dataset to the public domain. We also propose a BERT-based model, SkillBERT, the embeddings of which are used as features for classifying skills present in the ERRs into groups referred to as ""competency groups"". A competency group is a group of similar skills and it is used as matching criteria (instead of matching on skills) for finding the overlap of skills between the candidates and the jobs. This proxy match takes advantage of the BERT's capability of deriving meaning from the structure of competency groups present in the skill dataset. In our experiments, the SkillBERT, which is trained from scratch on the skills present in job requisitions, is shown to be better performing than the pre-trained BERT and the Word2Vec. We have also explored K-means clustering and spectral clustering on SkillBERT embeddings to generate cluster-based features. Both algorithms provide similar performance benefits. Last, we have experimented with different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and a deep learning algorithm Bi-LSTM . We did not observe a significant performance difference among the algorithms, although XGBoost and Bi-LSTM perform slightly better than Random Forest. The features created using SkillBERT are most predictive in the classification task, which demonstrates that the SkillBERT is able to capture information about the skills' ontology from the data.

"While protein sequence data is an emerging application domain for machine learning methods, small modifications to protein sequences can result in difficult-to-predict changes to the protein's function. Consequently, protein machine learning models typically do not use randomized data augmentation procedures analogous to those used in computer vision or natural language, e.g., cropping or synonym substitution. In this paper, we empirically explore a set of simple string manipulations, which we use to augment protein sequence data when fine-tuning semi-supervised protein models. We provide 276 different comparisons to the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE) baseline models, with Transformer-based models and training datasets that vary from the baseline methods only in the data augmentations and representation learning procedure. For each TAPE validation task, we demonstrate improvements to the baseline scores when the learned protein representation is fixed between tasks.  We also show that contrastive learning fine-tuning methods typically outperform masked-token prediction in these models, with increasing amounts of data augmentation generally improving performance for contrastive learning protein methods.  We find the most consistent results across TAPE tasks when using domain-motivated transformations, such as amino acid replacement, as well as restricting the Transformer attention to randomly sampled sub-regions of the protein sequence.  In rarer cases, we even find that information-destroying augmentations, such as randomly shuffling entire protein sequences, can improve downstream performance.

"Methods for automatically learning to solve routing problems are rapidly improving in performance. While most of these methods excel at generating solutions quickly, they are unable to effectively utilize longer run times because they lack a sophisticated search component. We present a learning-based optimization approach that allows a guided search in the distribution of high-quality solutions for a problem instance. More precisely, our method uses a conditional variational autoencoder that learns to map points in a continuous (latent) search space to high-quality, instance-specific routing problem solutions. The learned space can then be searched by any unconstrained continuous optimization method. We show that even using a standard differential evolution search strategy our approach is able to outperform existing purely machine learning based approaches.

"Uncertainty evaluation is a core technique when deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in real-world problems. In practical applications, we often encounter unexpected samples that have not seen in the training process. Not only achieving the high-prediction accuracy but also detecting uncertain data is significant for safety-critical systems. In statistics and machine learning, Bayesian inference has been exploited for uncertainty evaluation. The Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently attracted considerable attention in this context, as the DNN trained using dropout is interpreted as a Bayesian method. Based on this interpretation, several methods to calculate the Bayes predictive distribution for DNNs have been developed. Though the Monte-Carlo method called MC dropout is a popular method for uncertainty evaluation, it requires a number of repeated feed-forward calculations of DNNs with randomly sampled weight parameters. To overcome the computational issue, we propose a sampling-free method to evaluate uncertainty. Our method converts a neural network trained using the dropout to the corresponding Bayesian neural network with variance propagation. Our method is available not only to feed-forward NNs but also to recurrent NNs including LSTM. We report the computational efficiency and statistical reliability of our method in numerical experiments of the language modeling using RNNs, and the out-of-distribution detection with DNNs.

"Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs.   In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models.

"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have attracted a lot of research interest in the machine learning community in recent years. Although many variants have been proposed, we still lack a systematic view of different GCN models and deep understanding of the relations among them. In this paper, we take a step forward to establish a unified framework for convolution-based graph neural networks, by formulating the basic graph convolution operation as an optimization problem in the graph Fourier space. Under this framework, a variety of popular GCN models, including the vanilla-GCNs, attention-based GCNs and topology-based GCNs, can be interpreted as a same optimization problem but with different carefully designed regularizers. This novel perspective enables a better understanding of the similarities and differences among many widely used GCNs, and may inspire new approaches for designing better models. As a showcase, we also present a novel regularization technique under the proposed framework to tackle the oversmoothing problem in graph convolution.

"Real-world binary classification tasks are in many cases unbalanced i.e. the minority class is much smaller than the majority class. This skewness is challenging for machine learning algorithms as they tend to focus on the majority and greatly misclassify the minority. Oversampling the minority using \emph{SMOTE} before training the model is a popular method to address this challenge. Inspired by \emph{SMOTE}, we propose \emph{AE-SMOTE}, which by using an autoencoder, (1) maps the features to a dense continuous latent space, (2) applies oversampling by interpolation in the latent space, and (3) maps the synthetic samples back to the original feature space. While \emph{SMOTE} supports discrete (categorical) features, almost all variants and extensions of \emph{SMOTE} do not. Wrapping any one of these \emph{SMOTE} variants with an autoencoder will enable it to support multi-modal datasets that include discrete features. We have empirically shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach on 35 publicly available datasets.",in synthetic samples that are continuous rather than discrete thus not realistic Moreover many algorithms are optimized for handling discrete features e g Cat boost and M LPs with embedding and such augmentation will render these optimization s useless Our approach shifts the challenge of the discrete features from the interpolation method to the encoder decoder where we can leverage previous research Additionally more than 100 extensions and variants of SMOTE were proposed However to the best of our knowledge none of them support discrete features By mapping the discrete and continuous features to a unified continuous latent space we enable all these algorithms to produce multi modal data An overview of our method is shown in Figure 2 To solve the problem presented here it is required to create synthetic examples of structured data We explored several methods proposed in the literature and conclude that our Autoencoder based approach is by far superior to the available alternatives Unlike naive interpolation based methods it is sophisticated enough to avoid unrealistic examples On the other hand unlike GAN based approaches it is simple enough to run at scale and avoid system failures related to an overly com plex system such as over fitting and mode collapse We studied several Autoencoder variants and empirically concluded that the simple vanilla Autoencoder provides the best results To summarize the benefits of our approach and our contributions are 1 1 Our code can be found at https g it hub com an on user an on repo name,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML) has shown success at producing new video game content with machine learning. However, the majority of the work has focused on the production of static game content, including game levels and visual elements. There has been much less work on dynamic game content, such as game mechanics. One reason for this is the lack of a consistent representation for dynamic game content, which is key for a number of statistical machine learning approaches. We present an autoencoder for deriving what we call ""entity embeddings"", a consistent way to represent different dynamic entities across multiple games in the same representation. In this paper we introduce the learned representation, along with some evidence towards its quality and future utility.",far exceeded the first for our eva lua Data set t ions and so we only report

"Machine learning techniques have been widely used in natural language processing (NLP). However, as revealed by many recent studies, machine learning models often inherit and amplify the societal biases in data. Various metrics have been proposed to quantify biases in model predictions. In particular, several of them evaluate disparity in model performance between protected groups and advantaged groups in the test corpus. However, we argue that evaluating bias at the corpus level is not enough for understanding how biases are embedded in a model. In fact, a model with similar aggregated performance between different groups on the entire data may behave differently on instances in a local region. To analyze and detect such local bias, we propose LOGAN, a new bias detection technique based on clustering. Experiments on toxicity classification and object classification tasks show that LOGAN identifies bias in a local region and allows us to better analyze the biases in model predictions.",Table 2 Bias

"Retrieval and ranking models are the backbone of many applications such as web search, open domain QA, or text-based recommender systems. The latency of neural ranking models at query time is largely dependent on the architecture and deliberate choices by their designers to trade-off effectiveness for higher efficiency. This focus on low query latency of a rising number of efficient ranking architectures make them feasible for production deployment. In machine learning an increasingly common approach to close the effectiveness gap of more efficient models is to apply knowledge distillation from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. We find that different ranking architectures tend to produce output scores in different magnitudes. Based on this finding, we propose a cross-architecture training procedure with a margin focused loss (Margin-MSE), that adapts knowledge distillation to the varying score output distributions of different BERT and non-BERT passage ranking architectures. We apply the teachable information as additional fine-grained labels to existing training triples of the MSMARCO-Passage collection. We evaluate our procedure of distilling knowledge from state-of-the-art concatenated BERT models to four different efficient architectures (TK, ColBERT, PreTT, and a BERT CLS dot product model). We show that across our evaluated architectures our Margin-MSE knowledge distillation significantly improves re-ranking effectiveness without compromising their efficiency. Additionally, we show our general distillation method to improve nearest neighbor based index retrieval with the BERT dot product model, offering competitive results with specialized and much more costly training methods. To benefit the community, we publish the teacher-score training files in a ready-to-use package.",Utilizing our proposed Margin MSE loss in connection with our We now discuss our research questions

"In the present work, we explore the capability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the closure terms for large eddy simulations (LES) solely from coarse-scale data. To this end, we derive a consistent framework for LES closure models, with special emphasis laid upon the incorporation of implicit discretization-based filters and numerical approximation errors. We investigate implicit filter types, which are inspired by the solution representation of discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume schemes and mimic the behaviour of the discretization operator, and a global Fourier cutoff filter as a representative of a typical explicit LES filter. Within the perfect LES framework, we compute the exact closure terms for the different LES filter functions from direct numerical simulation results of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Multiple ANN with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) or a gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture are trained to predict the computed closure terms solely from coarse-scale input data. For the given application, the GRU architecture clearly outperforms the MLP networks in terms of accuracy, whilst reaching up to 99.9% cross-correlation between the networks' predictions and the exact closure terms for all considered filter functions. The GRU networks are also shown to generalize well across different LES filters and resolutions. The present study can thus be seen as a starting point for the investigation of data-based modeling approaches for LES, which not only include the physical closure terms, but account for the discretization effects in implicitly filtered LES as well.",of these simulations in Figure 3 demonstrate that the obtained coarse scale solution coincides with the respectively filtered DNS so lu tion for all considered filter forms This confirms our definition of a perfect LES In its own right Figure 3 already reveals some interesting insights Firstly as expected the choice of the filter defines the resolved field U as a coarse scale representation of the full solution The resolved fields show different properties in terms of locality and smoothness as caused by the filter Even more striking however is the difference in the closure terms induced by the filter underlining the statement that the optimal closure is a direct function of the LES filter form and thus the disc ret iz ation operator and its properties Supporting this further examination of the closure terms reveals that their statistics strongly depend on the chosen LES filter as shown in Figure 4 While the Fourier and FV filter show similar distributions of the closure terms in the momentum equation the distribution of the D G filtered data exhibits significantly higher variance This is caused by the element wise L projection which leads to large discontinuities in the,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Determining whether inputs are out-of-distribution (OOD) is an essential building block for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world. However, previous methods relying on the softmax confidence score suffer from overconfident posterior distributions for OOD data. We propose a unified framework for OOD detection that uses an energy score. We show that energy scores better distinguish in- and out-of-distribution samples than the traditional approach using the softmax scores. Unlike softmax confidence scores, energy scores are theoretically aligned with the probability density of the inputs and are less susceptible to the overconfidence issue. Within this framework, energy can be flexibly used as a scoring function for any pre-trained neural classifier as well as a trainable cost function to shape the energy surface explicitly for OOD detection. On a CIFAR-10 pre-trained WideResNet, using the energy score reduces the average FPR (at TPR 95%) by 18.03% compared to the softmax confidence score. With energy-based training, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on common benchmarks.",Does energy based OOD detection work better than the soft max based approach We begin by assessing the improvement of energy score over the soft max score Table 1 contains a detailed comparison for CI FAR 10 For inference time OOD detection without fine tuning we compare with the soft max confidence score baseline 13 We show that using energy score reduces the average F PR 95 by 18 03 compared to the baseline on CI FAR 10 Additional result sonS VH Nas in distribution data are provided in Table 6 where we show the energy score consistently outperforms the soft max score by 8 69 F PR 95 We also consider energy fine tuning and compare with Outlier Exposure OE 14 which regularizes the soft max probabilities to be uniform distribution for outlier training data For both approaches we fine tune on the same data and use the same training configurations in terms of learning rate and batch size Our energy fine tuned model reduces the F PR 95 by 5 20 on CI FAR 10 compared to OE The improvement is more pronounced on complex datasets such a sCI FAR 100 where we show a 10 55 improvement over OE To gain further insights we compare the energy score distribution for in and out of distribution data Figure 3 compares the energy and soft max score histogram distributions derived from pre trained as well as fine tuned networks The energy scores calculated from a pre trained network on both training and OOD data naturally form smooth distributions see Figure 3 b In contrast soft max scores for both in and out of distribution data concentrate on high values as shown in Figure 3 a Overall our experiments show that using energy makes the scores more distinguishable between in and out of distributions and as a result enables more effective OOD detection How does our approach compare to competitive OOD detection methods In Table 2 we compare our work against disc rim i native OOD detection methods that are competitive in literature All the numbers reported are averaged over six OOD test datasets We provide detailed results,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Detecting fine-grained differences in content conveyed in different languages matters for cross-lingual NLP and multilingual corpora analysis, but it is a challenging machine learning problem since annotation is expensive and hard to scale. This work improves the prediction and annotation of fine-grained semantic divergences. We introduce a training strategy for multilingual BERT models by learning to rank synthetic divergent examples of varying granularity. We evaluate our models on the Rationalized English-French Semantic Divergences, a new dataset released with this work, consisting of English-French sentence-pairs annotated with semantic divergence classes and token-level rationales. Learning to rank helps detect fine-grained sentence-level divergences more accurately than a strong sentence-level similarity model, while token-level predictions have the potential of further distinguishing between coarse and fine-grained divergences.",XL M blob master tools token ize sh All Divergent m BERT models outperform the 3 https code google com archive p berkeley align er LASER baseline by a large margin Table 3 The 4 https g it hub com facebook research proposed training strategy performs best improv LASER tree master tasks Wiki Matrix ing over LASER by 31 F 1 points Abl ation ex per 5 https g it hub com hugging face im ents and analysis further show the benefits of transformers 6 https g it hub com google research diverse contrastive samples and learning to rank BERT 7 https sci kit learn org 8 We mimic both generalization and particularization Equivalents Divergent s All Synthetic Loss Contrastive P R F 1 P R F 1 P R F 1 cid 55 70 56 62 78 87 82 75 76 75 Phrase Replacement CE cid 51 61 81 69 87 71 78 78 75 75 Margin cid 51 70 76 73 86 82 84 80 80 80 cid 55 81 50 62 77 93 85 78 78 77 Subtree Deletion CE cid 51 64 84 72 89 74 81 80 77 78 Margin cid 51 70 83 76 90 81 85 83 82 82 cid 55 65 53 57 76 84 80 72 73 72 Lexical Substitution CE cid 51 55 81 66 86 64 73 75 70 71 Margin cid 51 57 75 65 83 70 76 74 72 72 cid 55 76 42 54 74 93 83 75 75 73 Balanced CE cid 51 73 73 73 85 85 85 81 81 81 Margin cid 51 76 73 75 85 87 86 82 82 82 cid 55 62 32 42 70 89 79 67 69 66 Concatenation CE cid 51 73 55 63 78 89 83 76 77 76 Margin cid 51 84 59 70 81 94 87 82 82 81 Divergence Ranking Margin cid 51 82 72 77 86 91 88 84 85 84 LASER baseline 38 58 46 68 48 57 57 52 53 Table 3 Intrinsic evaluation of Divergent m BERT and its abl ation variants on the REF RES D data set We report Precision P Recall R and F 1 for the equivalent and divergent classes separately as well as for both classes All Divergence Ranking yields the best F 1 scores across the board a LASER b Subtree Deletion c Divergence Ranking Figure 3 Score distributions assigned by different models to sentence pairs of REF RES D Divergence Ranking scores for the Some meaning difference class are correctly skewed more toward negative values Contrastive Samples With the CE loss in de pen yields poor performance We suspect that the dent contrastive samples improve over randomly model is overwhelmed by negative instances at sampled synthetic instances overall 8 7 F 1 training time which biases it toward predicting the points on average at the cost of a smaller drop divergent class too often and hurting F 1 score for for the divergent class 5 3 F 1 points for mod the equivalent class el strained on a single type of divergence Using the Divergence Ranking How does divergence rank margin loss helps models recover from this drop ing improve predictions Figure 3 shows model Divergence Types All types improve over the score distributions for the 3 classes annotated in RE LASER baseline When using a single divergence F RES D Divergence Ranking particularly improves type Subtree Deletion performs best even match divergence predictions for the Some meaning d if ing the overall F 1 score of a system trained on all ference class the score distribution for this class types of divergences Balanced Sampling Train is more skewed toward negative values than when ing on the Concatenation of all divergence types training on contrastive Subtree Deletion samples Union Pair wise Union Intersection Model Multi task F 1 DIV F 1 EQ F 1 Mul 0 1 cm F 1 DIV F 1 EQ F 1 Mul 0 1 cm F 1 DIV F 1 EQ F 1 Mul Random Baseline 0 21 0 62 0 13 0 1 cm 0 33 0 59 0 20 0 1 cm 0 21 0 62 0 13 Token only 0 39 0 77 0 30 0 1 cm 0 46 0 88 0 41 0 1 cm 0 46 0 92 0 42 Balanced cid 51 0 41 0 77 0 32 0 1 cm 0 46 0 87 0 40 0 1 cm 0 43 0 91 0 40 Concatenation cid 51 0 41 0 78 0 32 0 1 cm 0 48 0 88 0 42 0 1 cm 0 46 0 92 0 42 Divergence Ranking cid 51 0 45 0 78 0 35 0 1 cm 0 51 0 88 0 45 0 1 cm 0 49 0 92 0 45 Table 4 Evaluation of different models on the token level prediction task for the Some meaning difference class of REF RES D Divergence Ranking yields the best results across the board,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic, and there were more than 10 million opioid misusers aged 12 or older each year. Identifying patients at high risk of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) can help to make early clinical interventions to reduce the risk of OUD. Our goal is to predict OUD patients among opioid prescription users through analyzing electronic health records with machine learning and deep learning methods. This will help us to better understand the diagnoses of OUD, providing new insights on opioid epidemic. Electronic health records of patients who have been prescribed with medications containing active opioid ingredients were extracted from Cerner Health Facts database between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2017. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were applied to predict opioid use disorder risk in the future based on recent five encounters, and compared to Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Dense Neural Network. Prediction performance was assessed using F-1 score, precision, recall, and AUROC. Our temporal deep learning model provided promising prediction results which outperformed other methods, with a F1 score of 0.8023 and AUCROC of 0.9369. The model can identify OUD related medications and vital signs as important features for the prediction. LSTM based temporal deep learning model is effective on predicting opioid use disorder using a patient past history of electronic health records, with minimal domain knowledge. It has potential to improve clinical decision support for early intervention and prevention to combat the opioid epidemic.",Our temporal deep learning model provided promising prediction results which

based temporal deep learning model is effective on predicting opioid use disorder using a patient s past history of electronic health records with minimal domain knowledge It has potential to improve clinical decision support for early intervention and prevention to combat the opioid epidemic Keywords Opioid use disorder machine learning deep learning electronic health records Introduction Opioid Use Disorder OUD is a physical or psychological reliance on opioids a class of substances found in certain prescription pain medications and illegal drugs like heroin 1 which includes opioid abuse and opioid dependence Misuse and abuse of opioids are responsible for the deaths of more than 130 Americans daily 2 making it a leading cause of accidental death in the United States Prescription opioids have been increasingly used due to its effectiveness in treating chronic pain 3 According to Han et al 4 91 8 million 37 8 civilian non institutionalized adults in the US consumed prescription opioids in 2015 Among them 11 5 million 4 7 misused them and 1 9 million 0 8 had a use disorder Prescription OUD s death has risen from over 4 000 to over 16 000 in 2010 making it the fastest growing form of drug abuse and overdose deaths involving opioids 5 OUD s among individuals using prescription opioids are now a significant public health concern Earlier intervention in the developmental trajectory of OUD has the potential to reduce significant impairment and morbidity if not mortality For example reducing opioid dosage or suggesting alternative options for chronic pain management can potentially reduce the risks of opioid use disorder CDC has also provided recommendations for chronic pain care on opioid prescription for primary care clinicians 6 In reality if the risk of OUD can be predicted for targeted patient groups early interventions can be made With the availability of electronic health records E HR of patients we can build predictive models on the history of E HR to predict the risk of OUD and provide explanation of top risk factors Based on that clinical decision support can be made 7 E HR has been widely adopted with the introduction of HI TECH Act of 2009 8 Besides E HR data managed by healthcare providers large scale E HR data are also made available through commercial E HR vendors for research purposes For example Cern er s Health Facts 9 is a large multi institutional de identified database derived from E HRs and administrative systems Traditional statistical and machine learning based models on OUD prediction have been discussed in previous work 10 13 For example Cox regression method is applied to extract most relevant features and then to build a multivariate regression model to fit those features to predict two year risk of opioid overdose 14 Ellis RJ s 15 studied GIN i importance effect size and Wilcox on rank sum test to measure the importance of different features and then applied a random forest class i fier to predict opioid dependence Except for random forest Decision Tree and Logistic Regression were also proposed in Wade kar s work 16 for OUD prediction using demographic information socioeconomic physical and psychological features and it identifies that the first use of marijuana before the age of 18 years is the most dominated predictor Lo Cig anic applied GB M and dense neural network models to build models for opioid overdose prediction using a set of hand crafted features including demographic information medical code information aggregated features such as daily morphine milligram equivalents 17 18 Recently deep learning methods are gaining popularity in E HR based predictive modeling For instance Raj k omar et al performed a large scale deep learning based study with high prediction accuracy using E HR data in multiple medical events prediction 19 Another study employed a fully connected deep neural network to suggest candidates for palliative care 20 Temporal oriented deep learning models were also applied to solve rel avant problems for instance Recurrent Neural Network RNN was proposed in Che s work to classify opioid users into long term users short term users and opioid dependent patients using diagnosis procedure and prescription information 21 Another study explored the application of RNN for chronic disease prediction using medical notes 22 Our recent work has applied fully connected networks for predicting diseases and improving coding 23 24 and opioid overdose prediction 25 In this paper we propose a temporal machine learning based prediction model built upon LSTM for predicting OUD among patients who have been prescribed with opioids medications using the history E HR data The temporal based model can better model the progression of diseases It can also identify the most important features for such predictions We took advantage of past medical history including diagnoses codes procedures codes laboratory results medications clinical events and demographic information of patients for training a prediction model We also compared our method with traditional machine learning algorithms and dense neural networks Our results demonstrated that with comprehensive E HR data our temporal deep learning model provided highly promising prediction results The highest F 1 score achieved was from the LSTM model precision 0 8184 recall 0 7865 f 1 score 0 8023 A UC 0 9369 We also discovered that the model can identify OUD related diagnoses and medications as important features for prediction Methods Data Source Cern er s Health Facts Database This database includes de identified E HR data from over 600 participating Cern er client hospitals and clinics in the United States In addition to encounters diagnoses procedures and patients demographics that are typically available in claims data Health Facts also includes medication dosage and administration information vital signs laboratory test results surgical case information other clinical observations and health systems attributes 26 Data Selection As patients with opioids prescription are the target cohort of this study we extracted all the patients who have been prescribed with medications containing active opioid ingredients in their medical records For retrieval of those ingredients we used the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ATC level 3 code ' N 02 A ' and categories description ' opioid ' to retrieve all relevant active ingredients from Drug Bank 5 1 4 27 Selected opioid related ingredients include but orphan ol dia morphine e lux a do line oxycodone oxy morph

ICD 10 codes to define opioid use disorder patients The summary of the codes can be found in Multimedia Appendix 1 Patients with one or more of these codes were considered OUD patients Opioid medications have proven successful in treatment of cancer pain 29 Cancer patients may receive many more opioid prescriptions than other patients which may lead the model to mis classify these patients as having OUD so we removed all patients with cancer diagnosis To identify patients with cancer we used the ICD 9 30 and ICD 10 codes 31 the summary can be found in Multimedia Appendix 2 The majority of OUD patients 91 08 is in the age group between 18 and 66 besides the number of patients with the highest increase rate is at 18 and the highest decrease rate is at 66 To make positive and negative cases consistent and prevent potential bias on ages we filtered both OUD and non OUD patients based on their age of first exposure to opioid medications between 18 and 66 The bar plot describing the age distribution of first opioid medication exposure for OUD patients is shown in Figure 1 After age filtering there are 111 456 positive OUD patients and 5 072 110 negative patients In the feature matrix for OUD patients we put together all information from encounters prior to the first encounter having an OUD diagnosis code while for non OUD patients we did a similar process for information from all encounters except the last one Feature Selection Information useful to predict future opioid use disorder includes diagnosis codes procedure codes lab tests medications clinical events and demographic information Diagnosis codes specify diseases symptoms poisoning for patients This history of diseases is critical information for predicting the future In Health Facts both ICD 9 and ICD 10 codes exist We converted all ICD 9 codes to ICD 10 codes to avoid dispersion of predictability for each diagnosis feature 32 and used the first 3 digits of the ICD 10 codes Compared to the detailed ICD codes with all digits the first 3 digits of ICD codes describe the general type of injury or disease which is better for prediction and can reduce the dimensions of features to accelerate the training process Medications are recorded by National Drug Code ND C code in Health Facts which give detailed label er product and package information To make better use of the action mechanism of medications we converted all ND C codes to ATC codes because ATC codes annotate active ingredients by the system organ they act on and their therapeutic p harm a co logical class Moreover by using ATC codes the number of medication related features is significantly reduced yet still those features are effective and carrying vital information ATC level 3 codes were chosen 33 to represent all medications For each medication the total medication quantity prescribed to each patient was taken as a feature for each medication In addition to the total medication quantity we also calculated the amount of opioid ingredients contained in each medication and converted it to morphine milligram equivalents MME as an aggregate feature 17 34 Lab Tests are procedures in which a health care provider takes a sample of a patient s blood urine other bodily fluid or body tissue to get information about the patient s health The numeric values for each test are recorded in Health Facts as well as the description of the value indicating whether it is higher than normal values lower than normal values or within the normal range We recorded the number of values higher and lower than normal values that the patient received and the total number of lab tests that the patients received Clinical events are related symptoms procedures and personal situations that are not formally classified into any codes above for instance the pain level of patients smoking history height weight and travel information Since 79 21 of hospitals in Health Facts have clinical event records they can be helpful for most hospitals for prediction Demographic information includes age gender and race ethnicity they are added to the feature space as well to improve the prediction We extracted 1 468 features 457

"Graphs are the most ubiquitous form of structured data representation used in machine learning. They model, however, only pairwise relations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order relations found in many real-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges. Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information. Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach, inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation, we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on representative benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the higher expressive power of HyperSAGE makes it more stable in learning node representations as compared to the alternatives.",are compared with state of the art methods These include a Multi layer perce ptr on with explicit hyper graph La plac ian regular is ation MLP HL R b Hyper graph Neural Networks HG NN Fen get al 2019 which uses a clique expansion and c Hyper GCN and its variants Ya dati et al 2019 that collapse the hyper edges using mediators For Hyper SAGE method we use 4 variants of generalized means M p with p 1 2 1 and 0 01 with complete neighborhood i e e For all the cases 10 data splits over 8 random weight initialization s are used totalling 80 experiments per method and for every data set The data splits are same as in Hyper GCN described in Appendix A 1 Table 1 shows the results obtained for the node classification task We see that the different variants of Hyper SAGE consistently show better scores across our benchmark datasets except Cora co citation where no improvement is observed compared to HG NN Cora co citation data is relatively very small in size with a cardinality of 3 0 1 1 and we speculate that there does not exist enough scope of improving with Hyper SAGE beyond what HG NN can express with the clique expansion,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Adversarial attacks are label-preserving modifications to inputs of machine learning classifiers designed to fool machines but not humans. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has mostly focused on high-level attack scenarios such as paraphrasing input texts. We argue that these are less realistic in typical application scenarios such as in social media, and instead focus on low-level attacks on the character-level. Guided by human cognitive abilities and human robustness, we propose the first large-scale catalogue and benchmark of low-level adversarial attacks, which we dub Z\'eroe, encompassing nine different attack modes including visual and phonetic adversaries. We show that RoBERTa, NLP's current workhorse, fails on our attacks.

"Federated Learning enables a population of clients, working with a trusted server, to collaboratively learn a shared machine learning model while keeping each client's data within its own local systems. This reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data, but it is still possible to reverse engineer information about a client's private data set from communicated model parameters. Most federated learning systems therefore use differential privacy to introduce noise to the parameters. This adds uncertainty to any attempt to reveal private client data, but also reduces the accuracy of the shared model, limiting the useful scale of privacy-preserving noise. A system can further reduce the coordinating server's ability to recover private client information, without additional accuracy loss, by also including secure multiparty computation. An approach combining both techniques is especially relevant to financial firms as it allows new possibilities for collaborative learning without exposing sensitive client data. This could produce more accurate models for important tasks like optimal trade execution, credit origination, or fraud detection. The key contributions of this paper are: We present a privacy-preserving federated learning protocol to a non-specialist audience, demonstrate it using logistic regression on a real-world credit card fraud data set, and evaluate it using an open-source simulation platform which we have adapted for the development of federated learning systems.",75 vs 25 At each protocol iteration each clients elected 1000 rows of training data at random as its local data for that iteration In order to evaluate our method we implement it in ABIDES an The holdout test data was the same for all clients and no client was agent based interactive discrete event simulation framework de ever permitted to train on it The clients then implemented Protocol scribe d by By rde tal 4 and available as open source software from 1 as described in the Approach section attempting to col labor a https g it hub com abides sim abides The selected platform t iv ely learn a credit card fraud detector despite each individual was originally deployed for financial market simulation but at its client having insufficient data possibly even zero fraudulent trans core provides a framework easily adapted to other domains The s ys actions to do so Under Protocol 1 the collaboration is performed tem operates in a single threaded manner to permit deterministic in such away as to not reveal any information about a client s data re simulation in the presence of stochastic elements but simulates using differential privacy within a secure multi party computation the actions often s of thousands of agents operating in parallel to one another The simulation Kernel tracks time in nanoseconds and 4 2 Protocol Timing Results enforces simulation physics including agent computation delays and pairwise noisy communication latency among agents Comp u The use of simulation to evaluate the protocol allowed us to con t ation delays can be pre configured or updated during execution struct an accurate model of how long it would take to run such to the actual time required for each computation All inter agent a protocol in the real world To accomplish this each simulation communication passes through the Kernel in the form of times client timed each section of its own part of the protocol cap tur tamped messages in a priority queue The nature of discrete event ing the actual time taken to run the Diffie Hellman setup once simulation permits efficient computation of sparse activity patterns the encryption and privacy steps every iteration and the local at high time resolution Many prior works on federated learning model training step every iteration The service agent captured calculate the running time of their protocol ignoring the com muni the actual time taken to receive and store each client s encrypted cation time to the server but we are able to simulate the latency of model each iteration and to combine the models once per iteration the distributed clients communication Our simulation also handles variable communication latency with each pair of agents having a minimum latency plus a cubic j it ter User component that is randomly generated per message Users Total Server DH Setup Training Encrypt In Table 1 we provide the timing results of the various steps of our protocol on the credit card fraud data set with all clients in,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Exploiting the rapid advances in probabilistic inference, in particular variational Bayes and variational autoencoders (VAEs), for anomaly detection (AD) tasks remains an open research question. Previous works argued that training VAE models only with inliers is insufficient and the framework should be significantly modified in order to discriminate the anomalous instances. In this work, we exploit the deep conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and we define an original loss function together with a metric that targets hierarchically structured data AD. Our motivating application is a real world problem: monitoring the trigger system which is a basic component of many particle physics experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

"This paper studies the automated control method for regulating air conditioner (AC) loads in incentive-based residential demand response (DR). The critical challenge is that the customer responses to load adjustment are uncertain and unknown in practice. In this paper, we formulate the AC control problem in a DR event as a multi-period stochastic optimization that integrates the indoor thermal dynamics and customer opt-out status transition. Specifically, machine learning techniques including Gaussian process and logistic regression are employed to learn the unknown thermal dynamics model and customer opt-out behavior model, respectively. We consider two typical DR objectives for AC load control: 1) minimizing the total demand, 2) closely tracking a regulated power trajectory.

"Unsupervised clustering of temporal data is both challenging and crucial in machine learning. In this paper, we show that neither traditional clustering methods, time series specific or even deep learning-based alternatives generalise well when both varying sampling rates and high dimensionality are present in the input data. We propose a novel approach to temporal clustering, in which we (1) transform the input time series into a distance-based projected representation by using similarity measures suitable for dealing with temporal data,(2) feed these projections into a multi-layer CNN-GRU autoencoder to generate meaningful domain-aware latent representations, which ultimately (3) allow for a natural separation of clusters beneficial for most important traditional clustering algorithms. We evaluate our approach on time series datasets from various domains and show that it not only outperforms existing methods in all cases, by up to 32%, but is also robust and incurs negligible computation overheads.",than D TW and its variants leading us to believe them to the A E Since f S is already a simplified re pre it is the best metric to report our results on SBD is based sent ation of our samples it should allow for faster training on cross correlation and uses coefficient normalization i e and more robust results but the optimization will only yield cid 16 cid 17 between 1 and 1 independent of data normalization The similar results if and only if 1 cid 80 NL f S f S cid 48 N i r i i coefficient normalization divides the cross correlation se cid 16 cid 17 que n ce by the geometric mean of auto correlations of the in N 1 cid 80 N i L r f S i f S i cid 48 This means that the loss as so divi dual sequences as below cia ted with transforming the reconstruction has to bee qui v a lent to the loss of reconstructing the transformations This CC cid 126 x cid 126 y should intuitively be true if our model is complex enough SBD cid 126 x cid 126 y 1 max w cid 112 to accurately learn both S and f S driving our choice in w R cid 126 x cid 126 x R cid 126 y cid 126 y,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Recent years have brought about a renewed interest in commonsense representation and reasoning in the field of natural language understanding. The development of new commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKG) has been central to these advances as their diverse facts can be used and referenced by machine learning models for tackling new and challenging tasks. At the same time, there remain questions about the quality and coverage of these resources due to the massive scale required to comprehensively encompass general commonsense knowledge. In this work, we posit that manually constructed CSKGs will never achieve the coverage necessary to be applicable in all situations encountered by NLP agents. Therefore, we propose a new evaluation framework for testing the utility of KGs based on how effectively implicit knowledge representations can be learned from them. With this new goal, we propose ATOMIC 2020, a new CSKG of general-purpose commonsense knowledge containing knowledge that is not readily available in pretrained language models. We evaluate its properties in comparison with other leading CSKGs, performing the first large-scale pairwise study of commonsense knowledge resources. Next, we show that ATOMIC 2020 is better suited for training knowledge models that can generate accurate, representative knowledge for new, unseen entities and events. Finally, through human evaluation, we show that the few-shot performance of GPT-3 (175B parameters), while impressive, remains ~12 absolute points lower than a BART-based knowledge model trained on ATOMIC 2020 despite using over 430x fewer parameters.",are observed in narrowly specific cond i vers it y of general commonsense knowledge t ions we show cf 5 that they perform better when eva lu ate don knowledge bases that prioritize ontological relations Furthermore we formalize the COMET framework of and whose examples resemble language like assertions e g Boss elute tal 2019 across different seed language models mango Is A fruit 2 Consequently the types of knowledge and training knowledge graphs and evaluate the common that can be directly accessed through the language model s sense knowledge hypothesized by these adapted knowledge interface remains limited models Our empirical study yields two promising con clu However prior work has also shown that training lan s ions First it confirms that KG adapted language models gu age models on knowledge graph tuples leads them to learn learn to express knowledge more precisely than naive lan to express their implicit knowledge directly Boss elute tal gu age models trained only on language And second we 2019 allowing them to provide commonsense knowledge show that ATOMIC 2 2 0 0 as a transfer resource leads to COMET on demand These adapted knowledge models have ex hi b models that achieve the largest increase over their seed lan it ed promising results on commonsense benchmarks com gu age model across all seed LMs for the commonsense pared with methods that require linking entities to knowl knowledge types it covers validating the importance of con edge graphs Sh war tze tal 2020 Liu et al 2020 Inspired struct ing knowledge resources with examples of knowledge by these successes we propose a dual use for commonsense not readily found in language models knowledge bases going forward as static graphs that can be Key Contributions In summary we make three key con linked to for discrete knowledge access and as resources tri but ions in this paper We present ATOMIC 20 a new com for adapting language models to hypothesize commonsense 20 mon sense knowledge graph covering social physical and knowledge about un annotated entities and events event ive aspects of everyday inferential knowledge cf 3 With this second purpose in mind we propose e val Next we compare ATOMIC 20 with other prominent CS KBs u a ting commonsense knowledge resources based on the 20 head to head and show that our new symbolic knowledge complementary information they can bring to pre trained graph is more accurate than any current CS KB see Ta language models We construct ATOMIC 20 a new high,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes 15% of childhood mortality, over 800,000 children under five every year, all over the world. This pathology is mainly caused by viruses or bacteria. X-rays imaging analysis is one of the most used methods for pneumonia diagnosis. These clinical images can be analyzed using machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which learn to extract critical features for the classification. However, the usability of these systems is limited in medicine due to the lack of interpretability, because of these models cannot be used to generate an understandable explanation (from a human-based perspective), about how they have reached those results. Another problem that difficults the impact of this technology is the limited amount of labeled data in many medicine domains. The main contributions of this work are two fold: the first one is the design of a new explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique based on combining the individual heatmaps obtained from each model in the ensemble. This allows to overcome the explainability and interpretability problems of the CNN ""black boxes"", highlighting those areas of the image which are more relevant to generate the classification. The second one is the development of new ensemble deep learning models to classify chest X-rays that allow highly competitive results using small datasets for training. We tested our ensemble model using a small dataset of pediatric X-rays (950 samples) with low quality and anatomical variability (which represents one of the biggest challenges). We also tested other strategies such as single CNNs trained from scratch and transfer learning using CheXNet. Our results show that our ensemble model outperforms these strategies obtaining highly competitive results. Finally, we confirmed the robustness of our approach using another pneumonia diagnosis dataset [1].",however by obtaining the average of all the models we increase the robustness of the model The average and standard deviation heat maps Figures 9 11 provide very interesting and relevant information related to the Ensemble output and how the system made a particular decision However the main problem related to this approach is the computational and time consuming requirements In our computer system it took about 400 seconds to calculate the heat maps for the five models in the Ensemble 4 3 Results with Kerman yet al data set Finally we want to investigate the robustness of our approach now using the data set of Kerman yet al 1 Analogous to that paper two classification problems were considered normal versus pneumonia and bacterial versus viral pneumonia We used the same training test sets partition as in that work and randomly subdivided training set into training 70 validation 30 partitions We trained 5 CNN models each with a different training validation partition We considered Arch 1 architecture for the individual models and followed a similar approach to previous experiments when this new data set is considered Table 5 shows the results related to normal versus pneumonia classification problem We observe that individual Arch 1 models achieve A UC s similar to that reported in 1 On the other hand the T PRof the individual models is smaller 0 91 versus 0 932 However the Ensemble formed by our individual models achieves an A UC of 0 976 and aT PRof 1 0 Therefore the Ensemble shows better robustness and metrics than our individual models and the model presented in 1 based on DenseNet and transfer learning Note that the metrics are better than our previous data set see section 4 1 which could be due Kerman yet al data set is larger than ours 5 856 X rays versus 950 and the original images are higher quality 1 2 million pixels versus 200 K so the training set contains much more information for constructing the models A UC T PR Kerman yet al model 0 968 0 932 Individual Arch 1 models 0 966 0 007 0 91 0 02 Arch 1 Ensemble 0 976 1 Table 5 Kerman yet al data set normal versus pneumonia classification comparison of AU Can dTP R values originally reported by Kerman yet al to results obtained by our models Table 6 indicates the results for the bacterial versus viral pneumonia classification problem Again it can be observed that individual Arch 1 models achieve A UC s values similar to that reported in 1 On the other hand the Ensemble formed by the individual models achieves an A UC value of 0 964 1,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Combining satellite imagery with machine learning (SIML) has the potential to address global challenges by remotely estimating socioeconomic and environmental conditions in data-poor regions, yet the resource requirements of SIML limit its accessibility and use. We show that a single encoding of satellite imagery can generalize across diverse prediction tasks (e.g. forest cover, house price, road length). Our method achieves accuracy competitive with deep neural networks at orders of magnitude lower computational cost, scales globally, delivers label super-resolution predictions, and facilitates characterizations of uncertainty. Since image encodings are shared across tasks, they can be centrally computed and distributed to unlimited researchers, who need only fit a linear regression to their own ground truth data in order to achieve state-of-the-art SIML performance.",suggest are mostly unnecessary for SIM L applications A key contribution of our analysis is the demonstration that a single set of general purpose features can encode rich information in satellite images We utilize an unsupervised learning methodology which separates feature construction from model fitting This approach dramatically increases computational speed for any given researcher and delivers large computational gains at the research system level by reorganizing how imagery is processed and distributed Traditionally hundreds or thousands of researchers use the same images to solve different and unrelated tasks e g Fig 1 A Our approach allows common sources of imagery to be converted into one centralized set of features that can be accessed by many researchers each solving different tasks This isolates future users from the costly steps of obtaining storing manipulating and processing imagery themselves The magnitude of the resulting benefits grow with the size of the expanding SIM L user community and the scale of global imagery data which currently increases by more than 80 TB day 12,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
We study the binary choice problem in a data-rich environment with asymmetric loss functions. The econometrics literature covers nonparametric binary choice problems but does not offer computationally attractive solutions in data-rich environments. The machine learning literature has many algorithms but is focused mostly on loss functions that are independent of covariates. We show that theoretically valid decisions on binary outcomes with general loss functions can be achieved via a very simple loss-based reweighting of the logistic regression or state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

"Although a number of studies have explored deep learning in neuroscience, the application of these algorithms to neural systems on a microscopic scale, i.e. parameters relevant to lower scales of organization, remains relatively novel. Motivated by advances in whole-brain imaging, we examined the performance of deep learning models on microscopic neural dynamics and resulting emergent behaviors using calcium imaging data from the nematode C. elegans. We show that neural networks perform remarkably well on both neuron-level dynamics prediction, and behavioral state classification. In addition, we compared the performance of structure agnostic neural networks and graph neural networks to investigate if graph structure can be exploited as a favorable inductive bias. To perform this experiment, we designed a graph neural network which explicitly infers relations between neurons from neural activity and leverages the inferred graph structure during computations. In our experiments, we found that graph neural networks generally outperformed structure agnostic models and excel in generalization on unseen organisms, implying a potential path to generalizable

"In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Most previous social media related research has been on English tweets and COVID-19. In this study, we collect approximately 1 million Arabic tweets from the Twitter streaming API related to COVID-19. Focussing on outcomes that we believe will be useful for Public Health Organizations, we analyse them in three different ways: identifying the topics discussed during the period, detecting rumours, and predicting the source of the tweets. We use the k-means algorithm for the first goal with k=5. The topics discussed can be grouped as follows: COVID-19 statistics, prayers for God, COVID-19 locations, advise and education for prevention, and advertising. We sample 2000 tweets and label them manually for false information, correct information, and unrelated. Then, we apply three different machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification, and Na{\""\i}ve Bayes with two sets of features, word frequency approach and word embeddings. We find that Machine Learning classifiers are able to correctly identify the rumour related tweets with 84{\%} accuracy. We also try to predict the source of the rumour related tweets depending on our previous model which is about classifying tweets into five categories: academic, media, government, health professional, and public.

"Relevance has significant impact on user experience and business profit for e-commerce search platform. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97\% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity. We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark.

"As biological gender is one of the aspects of presenting individual human, much work has been done on gender classification based on people names. The proposals for English and Chinese languages are tremendous; still, there have been few works done for Vietnamese so far. We propose a new dataset for gender prediction based on Vietnamese names. This dataset comprises over 26,000 full names annotated with genders. This dataset is available on our website for research purposes. In addition, this paper describes six machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forrest and Logistic Regression) and a deep learning model (LSTM) with fastText word embedding for gender prediction on Vietnamese names. We create a dataset and investigate the impact of each name component on detecting gender.

"Drug-drug interaction(DDI) prediction is an important task in the medical health machine learning community. This study presents a new method, multi-view graph contrastive representation learning for drug-drug interaction prediction, MIRACLE for brevity, to capture inter-view molecule structure and intra-view interactions between molecules simultaneously. MIRACLE treats a DDI network as a multi-view graph where each node in the interaction graph itself is a drug molecular graph instance. We use GCNs and bond-aware attentive message passing networks to encode DDI relationships and drug molecular graphs in the MIRACLE learning stage, respectively. Also, we propose a novel unsupervised contrastive learning component to balance and integrate the multi-view information. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real datasets show that MIRACLE outperforms the state-of-the-art DDI prediction models consistently.",We refer to the three models as LP Sub LP SE and LP OS E

"We introduce a deep learning framework designed to train smoothed elastoplasticity models with interpretable components, such as a smoothed stored elastic energy function, a yield surface, and a plastic flow that are evolved based on a set of deep neural network predictions. By recasting the yield function as an evolving level set, we introduce a machine learning approach to predict the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation that governs the hardening mechanism. This machine learning hardening law may recover classical hardening models and discover new mechanisms that are otherwise very difficult to anticipate and hand-craft. This treatment enables us to use supervised machine learning to generate models that are thermodynamically consistent, interpretable, but also exhibit excellent learning capacity. Using a 3D FFT solver to create a polycrystal database, numerical experiments are conducted and the implementations of each component of the models are individually verified. Our numerical experiments reveal that this new approach provides more robust and accurate forward predictions of cyclic stress paths than these obtained from black-box deep neural network models such as a recurrent GRU neural network, a 1D convolutional neural network, and a multi-step feedforward model.",of these three training experiments can be seen in Fig 9 The predictive capability of the model increases when higher order So bole v training is utilized with the best overall scores procured for H 2 norm based training Czar neck i et al 2017 had observed that constraining the H 1 terms in the loss function improves the function value prediction accuracy We are showing that by constraining the H 2 terms we are improving both the prediction of the function values and the first order derivatives along with the second order derivatives of the function A comparison of the predictive capabilities of an architecture without no added Multiply layers ddd and an L 2 norm training objective with a dm md md H 2 trained architecture can be seen in Fig 10 for the Modified Cam Clay hyper elastic law Borja et al 2001 Without any Multiply layers the ddd architecture cannot predict the stiffness measure properly all the predictions are 0 5 2 Benchmark Study 2 Training of yield function as a level set In this section we demonstrate the training process of the neural network level set yield functions utilized in this paper We demonstrate the neural networks ability to recover yield surfaces and their evolution completely from the data The purpose of the yield function neural networks is twofold to automate the discovery of complex yield surfaces and to facilitate the expression of non linear hardening laws In a first numerical experiment we test the ability of the neural networks to learn from a yield function level set data set and capture varying yield surface shapes The yield function neural net works have a feed forward architecture of a hidden Dense layer 100 neurons Re LU followed by two Multiply layers then another hidden Dense layer 100 neurons Re LU and an output Dense,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The recent introduction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their growing popularity in the past few years has enabled the application of deep learning algorithms to non-Euclidean, graph-structured data. GNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results across an impressive array of graph-based machine learning problems. Nevertheless, despite their rapid pace of development, much of the work on GNNs has focused on graph classification and embedding techniques, largely ignoring regression tasks over graph data. In this paper, we develop a Graph Mixture Density Network (GraphMDN), which combines graph neural networks with mixture density network (MDN) outputs. By combining these techniques, GraphMDNs have the advantage of naturally being able to incorporate graph structured information into a neural architecture, as well as the ability to model multi-modal regression targets. As such, GraphMDNs are designed to excel on regression tasks wherein the data are graph structured, and target statistics are better represented by mixtures of densities rather than singular values (so-called ``inverse problems""). To demonstrate this, we extend an existing GNN architecture known as Semantic GCN (SemGCN) to a GraphMDN structure, and show results from the Human3.6M pose estimation task. The extended model consistently outperforms both GCN and MDN architectures on their own, with a comparable number of parameters.",across an impressive array of graph based machine learning problems Nevertheless despite their rapid pace of development much of the work on GNNs has focused on graph classification and embedding techniques largely ignoring regression tasks over graph data In this paper we develop a Graph Mixture Density Network Graph MD N which combines graph neural networks with mixture density network MD N outputs By combining these techniques Graph M DNs have the advantage of naturally being able to incorporate graph structured information into a neural architecture as well as the ability to model multi modal regression targets As such Graph M DNs are designed to excel on regression tasks where in the data are graph structured and target statistics are better represented by mixtures of densities rather than singular values so called inverse problems To demonstrate this we extend an existing GNN architecture known as Semantic GCN Sem GCN to a Graph MD N structure and show results from the Human 3 6 M pose estimation task The extended model consistently outperforms both GCN and MD N architectures on their own with a comparable number of parameters,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Our experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework for EEG signal processing attained excellent classification results and feature extraction robustness under different machine learning classifier algorithms. Besides, in EEGsig, for selecting the best feature extracted, all EEG signal channels can be visible simultaneously; thus, the effect of each task on the signal can be visible.

"Parsing sentences into syntax trees can benefit downstream applications in NLP. Transition-based parsers build trees by executing actions in a state transition system. They are computationally efficient, and can leverage machine learning to predict actions based on partial trees. However, existing transition-based parsers are predominantly based on the shift-reduce transition system, which does not align with how humans are known to parse sentences. Psycholinguistic research suggests that human parsing is strongly incremental: humans grow a single parse tree by adding exactly one token at each step. In this paper, we propose a novel transition system called attach-juxtapose. It is strongly incremental; it represents a partial sentence using a single tree; each action adds exactly one token into the partial tree. Based on our transition system, we develop a strongly incremental parser. At each step, it encodes the partial tree using a graph neural network and predicts an action. We evaluate our parser on Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Treebank (CTB). On PTB, it outperforms existing parsers trained with only constituency trees; and it performs on par with state-of-the-art parsers that use dependency trees as additional training data. On CTB, our parser establishes a new state of the art.

"Mapping data from and/or onto a known family of distributions has become an important topic in machine learning and data analysis. Deep generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks ) have been used effectively to match known and unknown distributions. Nonetheless, when the form of the target distribution is known, analytical methods are advantageous in providing robust results with provable properties. In this paper, we propose and analyze the use of nonparametric density methods to estimate the Jensen-Shannon divergence for matching unknown data distributions to known target distributions, such Gaussian or mixtures of Gaussians, in latent spaces. This analytical method has several advantages: better behavior when training sample quantity is low, provable convergence properties, and relatively few parameters, which can be derived analytically. Using the proposed method, we enforce the latent representation of an autoencoder to match a target distribution in a learning framework that we call a {\em generative encoding network}. Here, we present the numerical methods; derive the expected distribution of the data in the latent space; evaluate the properties of the latent space, sample reconstruction, and generated samples; show the advantages over the adversarial counterpart; and demonstrate the application of the method in real world.",with provable properties In this paper is achieved typically by learning a transformation we propose and analyze the use of non parametric density methods to estimate the Jensen Shannon from a known distribution in a latent space into the divergence for matching unknown data dist rib u high dimensional data space However the inverse map t ions to known target distributions such Gau s ping is often problematic from samples into the latent s ian or mixtures of Gaussian s in latent spaces space and therefore it is often difficult to reason about This analytical method has several advantages the absolute or relative positions of data in that latent better behavior when training sample quantity is low provable convergence properties and rel space Models that map training samples into latent at iv ely few parameters which can be derived spaces with well defined properties are of significant analytically Using the proposed method we en value and interest For instance using such mappings force the latent representation of an Autoencoder one could compute data densities in the latent space to matcha target distribution in a learning frame and alleviate some of the challenges of density est i work that we call a generative encoding network Here we present the numerical methods derive mati on of arbitrary distributions in high dimensional the expected distribution of the data in the latent spaces This could be relevant for unsupervised learn space evaluate the properties of the latent space ing methods such as anomaly detection Chal apathy sample reconstruction and generated samples and Ch awl a 2019 One might also want to compare show the advantages over the adversarial co un or manipulate data samples in the latent space and ter part and demonstrate the application of the method in real world there by generate new realistic samples in controlled ways Zhu et al 2016 These motivations and others,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Diagnosis results are highly dependent on the volume of test set. To derive the most efficient test set, we propose several machine learning based methods to predict the minimum amount of test data that produces relatively accurate diagnosis. By collecting outputs from failing circuits, the feature matrix and label vector are generated, which involves the inference information of the test termination point. Thus we develop a prediction model to fit the data and determine when to terminate testing. The considered methods include LASSO and Support Vector Machine(SVM) where the relationship between goals(label) and predictors(feature matrix) are considered to be linear in LASSO and nonlinear in SVM. Numerical results show that SVM reaches a diagnosis accuracy of 90.4% while deducting the volume of test set by 35.24%.",are highly dependent on the vol diagnosis result 2 On the other hand reducing the test data ume of test set To derive the most efficient test set we propose volume could contribute to a lower cost and allow a reduction several machine learning based methods to predict the minimum in the size of the fault dictionary which is an important method amount of test data that produces relatively accurate diagnosis for fault diagnosis 3 By collecting outputs from failing circuits the feature matrix and label vector are generated which involves the inference In this paper we propose algorithms to reduce diagnostic information of the test termination point Thus we develop test vectors for circuits Linear Regression is regarded as one a prediction model to fit the data and determine when to of the most frequently used and well known statistical models terminate testing The considered methods include LASSO and that could be used to solve the problems mentioned above Support Vector Machine SVM where the relationship between Regression analysis represents a linear approach to model goals label and predictors feature matrix are considered to be linear in LASSO and nonlinear in SVM Numerical results show the relationship between dependent variables and independent that SVM reaches a diagnosis accuracy of 90 4 while deducting variables By finding the linear model between goals and the volume of test set by 35 24 predictors it is possible to predict the output values for some Index Terms volume optimization circuit testing linear re specific inputs Least square is the most important part of gres sion support vector machine the Linear Regression model which provides the approximation solution for an over determined system by minimizing the,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Purpose: We aimed to develop deep machine learning (DL) models to improve the detection and segmentation of intraprostatic lesions (IL) on bp-MRI by using whole amount prostatectomy specimen-based delineations. We also aimed to investigate whether transfer learning and self-training would improve results with small amount labelled data. Methods: 158 patients had suspicious lesions delineated on MRI based on bp-MRI, 64 patients had ILs delineated on MRI based on whole mount prostatectomy specimen sections, 40 patients were unlabelled. A non-local Mask R-CNN was proposed to improve the segmentation accuracy. Transfer learning was investigated by fine-tuning a model trained using MRI-based delineations with prostatectomy-based delineations. Two label selection strategies were investigated in self-training. The performance of models was evaluated by 3D detection rate, dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95 percentile Hausdrauff (95 HD, mm) and true positive ratio (TPR). Results: With prostatectomy-based delineations, the non-local Mask R-CNN with fine-tuning and self-training significantly improved all evaluation metrics. For the model with the highest detection rate and DSC, 80.5% (33/41) of lesions in all Gleason Grade Groups (GGG) were detected with DSC of 0.548[0.165], 95 HD of 5.72[3.17] and TPR of 0.613[0.193].

"With the recent implementation of the K to 12 Program, academic institutions, specifically, Colleges and Universities in the Philippines have been faced with difficulties in determining projected freshmen enrollees vis-a-vis decision-making factors for efficient resource management. Enrollment targets directly impacts success factors of Higher Education Institutions. This study covered an analysis of various characteristics of freshmen applicants affecting their admission status in a Philippine university. A predictive model was developed using Logistic Regression to evaluate the probability that an admitted student will pursue to enroll in the Institution or not. The dataset used was acquired from the University Admissions Office. The office designed an online application form to capture applicants' details. The online form was distributed to all student applicants, and most often, students, tend to provide incomplete information. Despite this fact, student characteristics, as well as geographic and demographic data based on the students' location are significant predictors of enrollment decision. The results of the study show that given limited information about prospective students, Higher Education Institutions can implement machine learning techniques to supplement management decisions and provide estimates of class sizes, in this way, it will allow the institution to optimize the allocation of resources and will have better control over net tuition revenue.",of the study show that given applicants who have been offered admission Bas u limited information about prospective students et al 2019 They are challenged by the uncertainty Higher Education Institutions can implement of human selection patterns which greatly affects the machine learning techniques to supplement target number of incoming students A belt et al management decisions and provide estimates of class 2015 sizes in this way it will allow the institution to The birth of K to 12 in the Philippines added up optimize the allocation of resources and will have to the increasing pressure of the HE Is college better control over net tuition revenue freshmen enrolment plunged to its lowest state in SY 2016 2017 that stretches to SY 2017 2018 Another Keywords Data Mining Education Data Mining growing concern is graduates of the K to 12 Senior Predictive Modeling Binary Classification Logistic High School program Grade 12 may or may not Regression intend to enroll college since the SH S curriculum was designed to prepare students for one of the following,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Developing high-performing predictive models for large tabular data sets is a challenging task. The state-of-the-art methods are based on expert-developed model ensembles from different supervised learning methods. Recently, automated machine learning (AutoML) is emerging as a promising approach to automate predictive model development. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an AutoML approach that generates and evaluates multiple neural network architectures concurrently and improves the accuracy of the generated models iteratively. A key issue in NAS, particularly for large data sets, is the large computation time required to evaluate each generated architecture. While data-parallel training is a promising approach that can address this issue, its use within NAS is difficult. For different data sets, the data-parallel training settings such as the number of parallel processes, learning rate, and batch size need to be adapted to achieve high accuracy and reduction in training time. To that end, we have developed AgEBO-Tabular, an approach to combine aging evolution (AgE), a parallel NAS method that searches over neural architecture space, and an asynchronous Bayesian optimization method for tuning the hyperparameters of the data-parallel training simultaneously. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method to generate high-performing neural network models for large tabular benchmark data sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the automatically discovered neural network models using our method outperform the state-of-the-art AutoML ensemble models in inference speed by two orders of magnitude while reaching similar accuracy values.",nous approach is justified by our practical case where the evaluated 9 get finished evaluations function can have significantly different run times

"Network function virtualization (NFV) proposes to replace physical middleboxes with more flexible virtual network functions (VNFs). To dynamically adjust to ever-changing traffic demands, VNFs have to be instantiated and their allocated resources have to be adjusted on demand. Deciding the amount of allocated resources is non-trivial. Existing optimization approaches often assume fixed resource requirements for each VNF instance. However, this can easily lead to either waste of resources or bad service quality if too many or too few resources are allocated. 

To solve this problem, we train machine learning models on real VNF data, containing measurements of performance and resource requirements. For each VNF, the trained models can then accurately predict the required resources to handle a certain traffic load. We integrate these machine learning models into an algorithm for joint VNF scaling and placement and evaluate their impact on resulting VNF placements. Our evaluation based on real-world data shows that using suitable machine learning models effectively avoids over- and under-allocation of resources, leading to up to 12 times lower resource consumption and better service quality with up to 4.5 times lower total delay than using standard fixed resource allocation.",in existing V NF placement algorithms are not very realistic in superior performance compared to using simpler models In contrast our machine learning approach learns accurate models automatically and directly from real V NF per for A V NF Placement Problem man ce measurements building on existing work on V NF performance profiling 1 3 Our work is complementary The main objective of V NF placement is to provide to most research in V NF placement as the resulting trained network services to users by embedding them in the substrate machine learning models can be integrated into existing network according to the current user demand In doing so approaches with little overhead V NF placement algorithms have to consider V NF resource requirements capacity limitations of the network and should B Approaches with Machine Learning minimize the resulting end to end delay by deploying V NF As one of the open challenges for machine learning in net instances close to their users For completeness we define working A you bie tal 15 mention the mapping from high this problem more formally in the following meta discourse level requirements to low level configurations Our work is largely in line with existing definitions of this problem 7 addressing this challenge by automatically mapping desired The substrate network G V L is the underlying V NF performance to required resource configurations compute network in which the given network services,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"The availability of different pre-trained semantic models enabled the quick development of machine learning components for downstream applications. Despite the availability of abundant text data for low resource languages, only a few semantic models are publicly available. Publicly available pre-trained models are usually built as a multilingual version of semantic models that can not fit well for each language due to context variations. In this work, we introduce different semantic models for Amharic. After we experiment with the existing pre-trained semantic models, we trained and fine-tuned nine new different models using a monolingual text corpus. The models are build using word2Vec embeddings, distributional thesaurus (DT), contextual embeddings, and DT embeddings obtained via network embedding algorithms. Moreover, we employ these models for different NLP tasks and investigate their impact. We find that newly trained models perform better than pre-trained multilingual models. Furthermore, models based on contextual embeddings from RoBERTA perform better than the word2Vec models.",In this section we will report the results for different NLP tasks using the existing and

the fact that most of the similarity scores cosine similarity between the word 1 and word 2 embedding s are higher The higher similarity score between the two words is caused by having almost

"Along with the importance of safety, an IDS has become a significant task in the real world. Prior studies proposed various intrusion detection models for the UAV. Past rule-based approaches provided a concrete baseline IDS model, and the machine learning-based method achieved a precise intrusion detection performance on the UAV with supervised learning models. However, previous methods have room for improvement to be implemented in the real world. Prior methods required a large labeling effort on the dataset, and the model could not identify attacks that were not trained before. To jump over these hurdles, we propose an IDS with unsupervised learning. As unsupervised learning does not require labeling, our model let the practitioner not to label every type of attack from the flight data. Moreover, the model can identify an abnormal status of the UAV regardless of the type of attack. We trained an autoencoder with the benign flight data only and checked the model provides a different reconstruction loss at the benign flight and the flight under attack. We discovered that the model produces much higher reconstruction loss with the flight under attack than the benign flight; thus, this reconstruction loss can be utilized to recognize an intrusion to the UAV. With consideration of the computation overhead and the detection performance in the wild, we expect our model can be a concrete and practical baseline IDS on the UAV.",showed the proposed model can be utilized to detect intrusion on the U AV 4 1 Setup We leveraged three log data benign flight DoS attack and GPS Spoofing at tack from the data set As our approach highlights the advantage of unsupervised learning we configured the training set only with the feature vectors from the benign flight On the other hand we configured two test sets from the DoS at tack log data and GPS Spoofing log data We randomly selected a particular timestamp as a starting point for the test set configuration where the chosen timestamp is located before the attack From this starting point we extracted every log data until the attack ends In this way we configured the test set to include patterns from both benign status and the status under attack In other words two test sets DoS attack and GPS Spoofing attack have patterns from the benign status and the status under attack at the sametime After we set the training set and the test set we applied the aforementioned feature engineering process Note that we scaled features in the test set with the scale r used in the training set 4 2 Experiment Result We trained a linear Autoencoder with the training set which is composed of the benign feature vectors only To fit benign patterns into the model we leveraged several techniques toward the model training A batch normalization is applied toward the encoder and the decoder We utilized both L 1 regularize r 15 and L 2 regularize r 6 to evade an over fitting problem and parameters are optimized with Adam optimizer for an effective model training After the model is fully trained we provided two test sets to the model and collected reconstruction losses The experiment results from the test of DoS attack and the GPS Spoofing attack is described in Fig 2 and Fig 3 Fig 2 explains the first take away of our experiment The blue part of the figure implies a reconstruction loss under the benign status and the red part of the figure stands for the loss under attack We figured out the reconstruction losses excessively rise when the flight is under attack at both DoS attack and the GPS Spoofing attack The reconstruction loss increases in a large amount when the feature vector from the flight under attack is provided furthermore Fig 3 shows the second take away of the experiment is also valid Fig 3 illustrates a distribution of reconstruction losses at both benign status and the status under attack The reconstruction loss distributes such far from the benign status at both DoS attack and GPS Spoofing attack A significant difference implies a large difference in a pattern thus we discovered our model effectively learned the dynamics of benign patterns and recognized any abnormal patterns on the U AV Despite a significant performance of our model however we figured out a room for improvement with the consideration of real world deployment Detailed contents are elaborated in the following section,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Generating music is an interesting and challenging problem in the field of machine learning. Mimicking human creativity has been popular in recent years, especially in the field of computer vision and image processing. With the advent of GANs, it is possible to generate new similar images, based on trained data. But this cannot be done for music similarly, as music has an extra temporal dimension. So it is necessary to understand how music is represented in digital form. When building models that perform this generative task, the learning and generation part is done in some high-level representation such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) or scores. This paper proposes a bi-directional LSTM (Long short-term memory) model with attention mechanism capable of generating similar type of music based on MIDI data. The music generated by the model follows the theme/style of the music the model is trained on. Also, due to the nature of MIDI, the tempo, instrument, and other parameters can be defined, and changed, post generation.",are audio files no image is produced and cannot be shown on paper The model generates results which sound fairly realistic and the music thus produced was not actually given as input Though some nuances of the input songs can be observed This means that we can tell that the model has learnt from the input songs The results can be improved by training on a much larger data set In our attempt we trained on only 92 songs for faster prototyping but this can be extended to huge datasets as well A valid question may arise What if the same starting note is used multiple times The answer is that it is most likely to produce the same output but this can be solved easily The input can be extended to a sequence of notes This sequence of notes can make space for many random combinations of starting notes Further for better availability the entire system has been converted into a web app It can be reached at https research jam lab in music generator The web app has a highly intuitive interface as can be seen in Fig 12 There is a Bi direction alL STM with Attention for Generating Unique Music 13 Fig 10 Model Accuracy Fig 11 Model Loss,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"This paper proposes CODER: contrastive learning on knowledge graphs for cross-lingual medical term representation. CODER is designed for medical term normalization by providing close vector representations for different terms that represent the same or similar medical concepts with cross-lingual support.

Training with relations injects medical knowledge into embeddings and aims to provide potentially better machine learning features.

The complexity of nonlinear SVM solvers and the number of elements in the kernel matrix quadratically increases with the number of samples in training data. Therefore, both runtime and memory requirements are negatively affected. Moreover, the parameter fitting has extra kernel parameters to tune, which exacerbate the runtime even further. This paper proposes an adaptive multilevel learning framework for the nonlinear SVM, which addresses these challenges, improves the classification quality across the refinement process, and leverages multi-threaded parallel processing for better performance. The integration of parameter fitting in the hierarchical learning framework and adaptive process to stop unnecessary computation significantly reduce the running time while increase the overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate reduced variance on prediction over validation and test data across levels in the hierarchy, and significant speedup compared to state-of-the-art nonlinear SVM libraries without a decrease in the classification quality. The code is accessible at https://github.com/esadr/amlsvm.",However the big is the number of data points and f is the number of features data imposes a certain difficulty to the most sophisticated but relatively slow versions of SVM namely the nonlinear SVM The Therefore as n increases the running time of the solver also complexity of nonlinear SVM solvers and the number of elements increases which hinders the usage of the nonlinear SVM for in the kernel matrix quadratically increases with the number of massive data sets samples in training data Therefore both runtime and memory As the size of many datasets continues to grow due to requirements are negatively affected Moreover the parameter the advancements in technologies such as high throughput se fitting has extra kernel parameters to tune which exacerbate the runtime even further This paper proposes an adaptive multi level que nc ing e commerce 3 and the Internet of Things 4 more learning framework for the nonlinear SVM which addresses scalable machine learning algorithms are required Therefore these challenges improves the classification quality across the while a nonlinear SVM is fast on small datasets and can pro refinement process and leverages multi threaded parallel pro vi de highly accurate prediction more research is required to ces sing for better performance The integration of parameter develop scalable nonlinear SVM solvers for massive datasets fitting in the hierarchical learning framework and adaptive process to stop unnecessary computation significantly reduce Our previous framework Multi level SVM MLS VM is the running time while increase the overall performance The a library that scales to millions of data points and exhibits experimental results demonstrate reduced variance on prediction up to two orders of magnitude faster running time com over validation and test data across levels in the hierarchy and pared to LIB SVM on reported benchmark datasets 5 The significant speedup compared to state of the art nonlinear SVM MLS VM leverages multi level algorithms that are inspired by libraries without a decrease in the classification quality The code is accessible at https g it hub com e sadr a mls vm the algebraic multi grid and some of its restricted versions 6 Index Terms Classification Multi level Computation Large These algorithms are known to be successful in accelerating scale learning Support Vector Machine computational optimization and modeling tasks without a loss in the quality Examples include hyper graph partitioning,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive number of attempts on the predictions of the number of cases and the other future trends of this pandemic have been made. However, they fail to predict, in a reliable way, the medium and long term evolution of fundamental features of COVID-19 outbreak within acceptable accuracy. This paper gives an explanation for the failure of machine learning models in this particular forecasting problem. The paper shows that simple linear regression models provide high prediction accuracy values reliably but only for a 2-weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning models, which have the potential of learning long term predictions with low errors, cannot achieve to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization ability. It is suggested in the paper that the lack of a sufficient number of samples is the source of low prediction performance of the forecasting models. The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is measured in terms of the cross-validation prediction errors, which are used as expectations for the generalization errors of the forecasters. To exploit the information, which is of most relevant with the active cases, we perform feature selection over a variety of variables. We apply different feature selection methods, namely the Pairwise Correlation, Recursive Feature Selection, and feature selection by using the Lasso regression and compare them to each other and also with the models not employing any feature selection. Furthermore, we compare Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Long-Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases together with the mentioned feature selection methods. Our results show that the accurate forecasting of the active cases with high generalization ability is possible up to 3 days only because of the small sample size of COVID-19 data.",in the in this particular forecasting problem The paper shows that published works some of the publications optimistically make simple Linear Regression models provide high prediction accuracy long term predictions for the pandemic 2 4 Furthermore values reliably but only for a 2 weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning models which have the potential of in most of the works the test performance of the forecasting learning long term predictions with low errors cannot achieve results has not been demonstrated well due to the restricted to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization size of the available time series data covering several months ability It is suggested in the paper that the lack of a sufficient only 1 2 4 number of samples is the source of low prediction performance In this study we perform an analysis on the genera liza of the forecasting models The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is measured in terms of the cross tion ability of the data dependent forecasters to explain why validation prediction errors which are used as expectations forecasting models used for determining the trend of C OVID for the generalization errors of the forecasters To exploit the 19 cases possess poor medium and long term prediction information which is of most relevant with the active cases we performances in the special case of machine learning models perform feature selection over a variety of variables such as For this purpose a forecasting system that consists of a feature the numbers of active cases deaths recoveries and people per kilometer square We apply different feature selection methods selection module and a machine learning based forecasting namely the Pairwise Correlation Recursive Feature Selection module is designed and implemented In the early phase of and features election by using the Lasso regression and compare our studies we observed that such an architecture provides them to each other and also with the models not employing any the best forecasting performance among the considered models feature selection Furthermore we compare Linear Regression including the standard architectures of Linear Regression LR Multi Layer Perce ptr on and Long Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases together with the Multi Layer Perce ptr on MLP and Long Short Term Memory mentioned feature selection methods Our results show that the LSTM state of the art models with or without feature se lec accurate forecasting of the active cases with high generalization tion The rational behind the choice of these models relies ability is possible up to 3 days only because of the small on the following three facts 1 LR is a linear static model sample size of C OVID 19 data We observe that the linear which is the least complex architecture so possessing the high regression model has much better prediction performance with high generalization ability as compared to the complex models generalization ability 5 2 MLP is a nonlinear static neural but as expected its performance decays sharply for more than network model which has universal function approximation 14 days prediction horizons property and can be said to be the most widely used neural Index Terms C OVID 19 forecasting machine learning fe a network model with producing successful results in many ture selection generalization applications 6 3 LSTM is are current neural network model which is capable of approximating to the nonlinear dynamics and has proved itself as the best model in many challenging,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"This work provides a comprehensive review of existing frameworks based on secure computing techniques in the context of private image classification. The in-depth analysis of these approaches is followed by careful examination of their performance costs, in particular runtime and communication overhead. To further illustrate the practical considerations when using different privacy-preserving technologies, experiments were conducted using four state-of-the-art libraries implementing secure computing at the heart of the data science stack: PySyft and CrypTen supporting private inference via Secure Multi-Party Computation, TF-Trusted utilising Trusted Execution Environments and HE- Transformer relying on Homomorphic encryption. Our work aims to evaluate the suitability of these frameworks from a usability, runtime requirements and accuracy point of view. In order to better understand the gap between state-of-the-art protocols and what is currently available in practice for a data scientist, we designed three neural network architecture to obtain secure predictions via each of the four aforementioned frameworks. Two networks were evaluated on the MNIST dataset and one on the Malaria Cell image dataset. We observed satisfying performances for TF-Trusted and CrypTen and noted that all frameworks perfectly preserved the accuracy of the corresponding plaintext model.",As it can be observed in Table 2 all frameworks preserve the accuracy of the plaintext model when performing private inference It can be seen that CrypT en is significantly faster than Py Syf t which is clearer in Model Z This is an interesting find as CrypT en requires share conversions between AdditiveS S and GCs 30 which has been previously reported as inefficient 21 We attribute the discrepancy in run times to the use of different communication back ends and the serialization and de serialization applied Additionally the results show that CrypT en requires less bandwidth which could be explained by the use of Garbled Circuits to represent Re LU activation s while the Py Syf t implementation of Re LU requires more communication between parties for the additive shares to be exchanged While there are inherent performance differences between Tensor flow and Py Torch it can be seen that T F Trusted is able to evaluate larger models such as Model Z much faster Intuitively this makes sense as the inference is performed inside the enclave using a plain text version of the data While HE Transformer also preserves the accuracy this comes at a much higher computational and memory cost mainly due to the communication with the client after every fully connected or convolutional layer where the non linearity is applied 1 https g it hub com veneta har iso privacy s mpc 2 https g it hub com veneta har iso privacy tee he,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"This paper presents an in-depth investigation of the effectiveness of dependency-based syntactic features on the irony detection task in a multilingual perspective (English, Spanish, French and Italian). It focuses on the contribution from syntactic knowledge, exploiting linguistic resources where syntax is annotated according to the Universal Dependencies scheme. Three distinct experimental settings are provided. In the first, a variety of syntactic dependency-based features combined with classical machine learning classifiers are explored. In the second scenario, two well-known types of word embeddings are trained on parsed data and tested against gold standard datasets. In the third setting, dependency-based syntactic features are combined into the Multilingual BERT architecture. The results suggest that fine-grained dependency-based syntactic information is informative for the detection of irony.",with existing systems when evaluated in multiple languages We believe this is an important first step before moving to complex scenarios where both syntax and pragmatic knowledge are incorporated into deep learning models which could lead to explicitly model the syntax pragmatic interface of irony To this end we propose to address the following research questions R Q 1 Can morphological and syntactic knowledge be helpful in addressing the task of irony detection We exploit linguistic resources syntactically annotated according to a well known dependency based scheme Universal Dependencies 2 UD The versatility of the UD format allows us to apply our approaches for the detection of irony independently of a target language Further more we experimented with UD based word embedding s and to the best of our knowledge neither UD annotations nor syntax based pre trained embedding s have previously been used for irony de tec tion R Q 2 To what extent do ad hoc resources in UD format tree banks improve irony detection performances We propose three distinct experimental settings Firstly a variety of syntactic dependency based features combined with classical machine learning class if i ers are explored with the aim of finding the most informative set of features for detecting the presence of irony In the second scenario two well known word embedding models are tested against gold standard datasets Finally in the third setting dependency based syntactic features are combined into the Multilingual BERT architecture Our results show that our models outperform syntax agnostic ones which is an important first step towards syntactically informed irony detection R Q 3 Are results obtained using syntactic features stable across different languages We experiment with datasets made available from previous shared tasks on irony detection in four languages French DEFT 2017 Ben a marae tal 2017 English Se mE val 2018 Task 3 Van He eet al 2018 Spanish I roS vA Ortega Bueno et al 2019 and Italian Iron IT A C ign are lla et al 2018 The obtained results overcome the competitive baselines and are also favorably comparable with the best results reported in shared tasks on irony for the four studied languages On the other hand this study takes the opportunity to enrich such existing datasets with morphological and syntactic information as encoded in UD 2 https universal dependencies org The paper is organized as follows In the next section related work regarding irony detection is surveyed while Section 3 describes the data and experimental settings we followed In Section 4 we provide a description of the experiments we performed and in the last section we discuss the experiments and provide some final remarks through an error analysis We conclude the paper with some insights about the impact of morph o syntax information and suggest possible directions for future work,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de facto tool for performing machine learning tasks on graphs. Most GNNs belong to the family of message passing neural networks (MPNNs). These models employ an iterative neighborhood aggregation scheme to update vertex representations. Then, to compute vector representations of graphs, they aggregate the representations of the vertices using some permutation invariant function. One would expect the hidden layers of a GNN to be composed of parameters that take the form of graphs. However, this is not the case for MPNNs since their update procedure is parameterized by fully-connected layers. In this paper, we propose a more intuitive and transparent architecture for graph-structured data, so-called Random Walk Graph Neural Network (RWNN). The first layer of the model consists of a number of trainable ``hidden graphs'' which are compared against the input graphs using a random walk kernel to produce graph representations. These representations are then passed on to a fully-connected neural network which produces the output. The employed random walk kernel is differentiable, and therefore, the proposed model is end-to-end trainable. We demonstrate the model's transparency on synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate the model on graph classification datasets and show that it achieves competitive performance.",in several classification tasks However nowadays they have been largely overshadowed by GN Ns This is mainly due to the complexity of kernel methods but also because data representation produced by graph kernels and learning performed by SVM are independent from each other On the other hand neural network models can learn representations that are useful for the task at hand In contrast to graph kernels which directly compare graphs to each other MP NN s first transform graphs into vectors by aggregating the representations of their vertices and then some function is applied to these graph representations i e modeled by a multi layer perce ptr on Furthermore it is usually hard to interpret and understand what these models have learned Ideally we would like to have a model that applies directly some function to the input graphs without first transforming them into vectors In this paper we propose such an architecture called Random Walk Graph Neural Network RW NN The model contains a number of trainable hidden graphs and it compares the input graphs against these graphs using a random walk kernel The kernel values are then passed on to a fully connected neural network which produces the output The employed random walk kernel is differentiable and we can thus update the hidden graphs during training with back propagation Hence the proposed neural network is end to end trainable Furthermore it delivers the best of both worlds from graph kernels and neural networks i e it retains the flexibility of kernel methods which can be easily applied to structured data e g graphs and also learns task dependent features without the need for feature engineering We compare the performance of the proposed model to state of the art graph kernels and recently proposed neural architectures on several benchmark datasets for graph classification Results show that our model matches or outperforms competing methods Our main contributions are summarized as follows We propose a novel neural network model Random Walk Graph Neural Network which employs a random walk kernel to produce graph representations Importantly the model is highly interpret able since it contains a set of trainable graphs We develop an efficient computation scheme to reduce the time and space complexity of the proposed model We demonstrate the model s high transparency on synthetic datasets and evaluate its per for man ce on several graph classification datasets where it achieves performance comparable to state of the art GN Ns and graph kernels The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 provides an overview of the related work Section 3 introduces some preliminary concepts Section 4 provides a detailed description of the proposed model Section 5 evaluates the proposed model both in terms of its transparency and of its performance Finally Section 6 concludes,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"This paper describes a novel machine learning (ML) framework for tropical cyclone intensity and track forecasting, combining multiple ML techniques and utilizing diverse data sources. Our multimodal framework, called Hurricast, efficiently combines spatial-temporal data with statistical data by extracting features with deep-learning encoder-decoder architectures and predicting with gradient-boosted trees. We evaluate our models in the North Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins on 2016-2019 for 24-hour lead time track and intensity forecasts and show they achieve comparable mean absolute error and skill to current operational forecast models while computing in seconds. Furthermore, the inclusion of Hurricast into an operational forecast consensus model could improve over the National Hurricane Center's official forecast, thus highlighting the complementary properties with existing approaches.

"The classification of sleep stages is the first and an important step in the quantitative analysis of polysomnographic recordings. Sleep stage scoring relies heavily on visual pattern recognition by a human expert and is time consuming and subjective. Thus, there is a need for automatic classification. In this work we developed machine learning algorithms for sleep classification: random forest (RF) classification based on features and artificial neural networks (ANNs) working both with features and raw data. We tested our methods in healthy subjects and in patients. Most algorithms yielded good results comparable to human interrater agreement. Our study revealed that deep neural networks (DNNs) working with raw data performed better than feature-based methods.

We use a real data set from Ecopark Township, a real estate development project in Hanoi, Vietnam, where we study two machine learning algorithms from the deep generative models literature to create a population of synthetic agents: Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN).

"In recent years, machine learning and deep learning approaches such as artificial neural networks have gained in popularity for the resolution of automatic puzzle resolution problems. Indeed, these methods are able to extract high-level representations from images, and then can be trained to separate matching image pieces from non-matching ones. These applications have many similarities to the problem of ancient document reconstruction from partially recovered fragments. In this work we present a solution based on a Graph Neural Network, using pairwise patch information to assign labels to edges representing the spatial relationships between pairs. This network classifies the relationship between a source and a target patch as being one of Up, Down, Left, Right or None. By doing so for all edges, our model outputs a new graph representing a reconstruction proposal. Finally, we show that our model is not only able to provide correct classifications at the edge-level, but also to generate partial or full reconstruction graphs from a set of patches.",Our model was implemented using py torch and torch geometric 4 a py torch library for graph neural networks For memory and computation efficiency the computations were made using float 16 precision The loss function is the cat eg or ical cross entropy computed between the ground truth and predicted edge feature matrix and the optimizer is Adam We split our data set into 3394 train ing images 500 validation images and 200 test images During training the order of node pairs is shuffled for each image and at each iteration to avoid an over fitting caused by the order of appearance of edges As we explained earlier we have a huge class imbalance towards the fifth class so to remedy this problem we decided to weight the loss for each class A weight of 0 1 was assigned to the fifth class and a weight of 0 8 for each of the remaining classes During training and validation we computed the balanced accuracy average of recall obtained on each class instead of the classic accuracy percentage of correct predictions to take into account class imbalance and have a score more representative of our model s ability to predict correct pairwise assemblies 2 7 We also computed the F 1 score for each class as 1 versus all binary classification results Fig 3 Evolution of balanced accuracy and categorical cross entropy loss during train ing Our results see Fig 3 and Table 3 obtained after 30 epochs show that we reach a limit with a satisfying value of 86 balanced accuracy on the validation set However eventhough we used a weighted loss the fifth class corresponding to no patch assembly is the most correctly predicted We can safely assume that a part of the features extracted by the Pairwise Comparison Model are related to the gradient of pixel values at the junction zones This explains why Using Graph Neural Networks to Reconstruct Ancient Documents 7 the fifth class remains the best predicted class given that it is easy to differ ent i ate between a high gradient corresponding to an absence of assembly and a low gradient corresponding to a possible assembly but difficult to infer the direction of the match from such information Table 3 Value of loss balanced accuracy and per class F 1 score obtained after train ing for 30 epochs Loss A ccF 1 1 F 1 2 F 1 3 F 1 4 F 1 5 Training 0 46 0 86 0 65 0 63 0 50 0 51 0 81 Validation 0 43 0 86 0 69 0 67 0 54 0 52 0 83 Test 0 42 0 85 0 69 0 68 0 53 0 52 0 81 Even though our results are convincing they are based on the pairwise cl as s if i cation of patch pairs and not on the actual whole image reconstruction The problem for evaluating the quality of image reconstructions is that with our model each node is susceptible to have multiple neighbour candidates in each direction One solution is to filter automatically the results based on a threshold on the class associated probabilities and to consider every alignment pro babil it y inferior to this threshold as an occurrence of the no patch assembly class but there is a risk to delete alignments correctly predicted but without enough confidence Instead of this we opted for an interactive visualization of the as sem bly proposal graphs allowing the user to delete some obviously wrong to the human eye edges,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

From this, we are able to compute the fraction of dilute particles to determine if the system is in the homogeneous dilute, dense, or coexistence region.

"The ability to perform accurate prognosis of patients is crucial for proactive clinical decision making, informed resource management and personalised care. Existing outcome prediction models suffer from a low recall of infrequent positive outcomes. We present a highly-scalable and robust machine learning framework to automatically predict adversity represented by mortality and ICU admission from time-series vital signs and laboratory results obtained within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. The stacked platform comprises two components: a) an unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder that learns an optimal representation of the time-series, using it to differentiate the less frequent patterns which conclude with an adverse event from the majority patterns that do not, and b) a gradient boosting model, which relies on the constructed representation to refine prediction, incorporating static features of demographics, admission details and clinical summaries. The model is used to assess a patient's risk of adversity over time and provides visual justifications of its prediction based on the patient's static features and dynamic signals. Results of three case studies for predicting mortality and ICU admission show that the model outperforms all existing outcome prediction models, achieving PR-AUC of 0.891 (95$%$ CI: 0.878 - 0.969) in predicting mortality in ICU and general ward settings and 0.908 (95$%$ CI: 0.870-0.935) in predicting ICU admission.",obtained within the first 24 hours of hospital ad been a fac il it at or of innovations aiming to improve patient mission The stacked Ensemble platform comprises two care A prominent example is the development of early warn components a an unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder that learns an optimal representation of the time series using ing systems that predict adversity from patient physiological it to differentiate the less frequent patterns which conclude measurements The majority of early warning models take the with an adverse event from the majority patterns that do form of ad hoc scoring tools 40 such as the National Early not and b a gradient boosting model which relies on the Warning Score NEWS 2 widely used in the United Kingdom constructed representation to refine prediction by in cor 54 Such tools estimate a patient s risk of adversity using po rating static features The model is used to assess a patient s risk of adversity and provides visual justifications aggregates of physiological measurements 27 Generally of its prediction Results of three case studies show that the scoring tools suffer from low sensitivity due to overlooking model outperforms existing platforms in ICU and general the dependencies among the temporal signatures underlying ward settings achieving average Precision Recall Areas a patient s physiology Machine Learning models have been Under the Curve PR A UC s of 0 891 95 CI 0 878 0 939 developed to overcome the limitations of scoring tools via for mortality and 0 908 95 CI 0 870 0 935 in predicting ICU admission and read mission sophisticated architectures that capture non linear i ties within the multivariate temporal patient data 12 Despite the promising results of Machine Learning early Submitted on 18 11 2020 revised on 26 03 2021 and 22 05 2021 accepted on 06 06 2021 ZI and RJ BD are supported by 1 N IHR warning systems we find that existing approaches bear several Biomedical Research Centre at SLaM and King s College London Lon shortcomings that adversely affect model performance and don U K and 2 N IHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical adoption potential First generic clinical outcome pre dic Research Centre RJ BD is further supported by 1 Health Data Re search H DR UK and 2 The Big Data Heart Consortium under grant tion models are scarce Most existing models are condition agreement No 116074 AS is supported by a King s Medical Research specific being developed and evaluated with a single condition Trust studentship DMB is funded by a UKR I Innovation Fellowship as in mind e g sepsis 36 cardiac patients 31 C OVID 19 70 part of Health Data Research UK MR S 00310 X 1 H Wis supported by MRC and H DR UK Grant MR S 004149 1 and Wellcome Institutional brain injury 51 The few condition agnostic models available Translation Partnership Award P III 054 J TH Tis supported by London are mostly limited to intensive care ICU settings where the A I Medical Imaging Centre for Value Based Healthcare A I 4 V BH and magnitude of measurements is high and the population is N IHR Applied Research Collaboration South London at King s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust more uniform in acuity levels 4 64 Second predicting ZI DB TS L Q Z K and RJ BD are with the Department of adverse clinical outcomes is an imbalanced learning problem Biostatistics and Health Informatics King s College London SE 5 because any adverse outcome is only present in a minority 8 AF UK zina ibrahim daniel bean thomas searle ling long qian z eljko kr al je vic richard j dobson kcl ac uk H W RJ BD and ZI are of the patient sample used to train and evaluate a model To with the Institute of Health In for am tics University College London UK illustrate consider the United Kingdom s in hospital mortality hong han wu r dobson z ibrahim ucl ac uk AS is with the Depart rates which are around 23 in ICU settings 3 and 4 in ment of Clinical Neuroscience King s College London London UK an th ony she kh kcl ac uk JG is with the Centre for Rheumatic Diseases secondary wards 21 Similarly cardiac arrest incidence is King s College London james galloway kcl ac uk SN is jointly ap estimated to be 2 3 of ICU admissions 2 Nevertheless pointed by the Department of Psychology and the Department of In fl am most current adversity prediction models are benchmarked mati on Biology King s College London sam norton kcl ac uk JT is with King s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust james teo nhs net using the Area Under the Curve ROC A UC 1 10 29,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"In tasks such as surveying or monitoring remote regions, an autonomous robot must move while transmitting data over a wireless network with unknown, position-dependent transmission rates. For such a robot, this paper considers the problem of transmitting a data buffer in minimum time, while possibly also navigating towards a goal position. Two approaches are proposed, each consisting of a machine-learning component that estimates the rate function from samples; and of an optimal-control component that moves the robot given the current rate function estimate. Simple obstacle avoidance is performed for the case without a goal position. In extensive simulations, these methods achieve competitive performance compared to known-rate and unknown-rate baselines.

"Developing machine learning enabled smart manufacturing is promising for composite structures assembly process. To improve production quality and efficiency of the assembly process, accurate predictive analysis on dimensional deviations and residual stress of the composite structures is required.

To overcome those problems, we propose a neural network Gaussian process model considering input uncertainty for composite structures assembly. Deep architecture of our model allows us to approximate a complex process better, and consideration of input uncertainty enables robust modeling with complete incorporation of the process uncertainty.

"The periodic table is a fundamental representation of chemical elements that plays essential theoretical and practical roles. The research article discusses the experiences of unsupervised training of neural networks to represent elements on the 2D latent space based on their electron configurations. To emphasize chemical properties of the elements, the original data of electron configurations has been realigned towards valence orbitals. Recognizing seven shells and four subshells, the input data has been arranged as 7x4 images. Latent space representation has been performed using a convolutional beta variational autoencoder (beta-VAE). Despite discrete and sparse input data, the beta-VAE disentangles elements of different periods, blocks, groups, and types. The unsupervised representation of elements on the latent space reveals pairwise symmetries of periods and elements related to the invariance of quantum numbers of corresponding elements. In addition, it isolates outliers that turned out to be known cases of Madelung's rule violations for lanthanide and actinide elements. Considering the generative capabilities of beta-VAE, the supervised machine learning has been set to find out if there are insightful patterns distinguishing electron configurations between real elements and decoded artificial ones. Also, the article addresses the capability of dual representation by autoencoders. Conventionally, autoencoders represent observations of input data on the latent space. By transposing and duplicating original input data, it is possible to represent variables on the latent space which can lead to the discovery of meaningful patterns among input variables. Applying that unsupervised learning for transposed data of electron configurations, the order of input variables that has been arranged by the encoder on the latent space has turned out to exactly match the sequence of Madelung's rule.",Table 1 Original a and realigned b data of electron configurations of the elements across the seven shells An example of the chemical elements representation on the latent space based on the original electron configurations along the seven shells Table 1 a is shown in Figure 2 It can be noted that the representation has low information value other than a sequential order of elements based on their atomic numbers Thus the latent space manifold has no separations along periods color coded and has no significant irregularities except for some sharp corners Figure 2 Example of the chemical elements representation on the latent space based on the original data of electron configurations The representations on the latent space included 2 D and 3 D experiments It turns out that 3 D latent space provides a smaller loss when keeping other hyper parameters unchanged but significantly challenges interpretations The paper is limited to 2 D representations but as a research instrument the 3 D or even higher dimensional i ties might be useful Other experimentation s have been performed concerning the architecture of neural networks and tuning of the beta and other hyper parameters The finalized versions of the applied neural networks are provided in the Appendix N,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Energy forecasting has a vital role to play in smart grid (SG) systems involving various applications such as demand-side management, load shedding, and optimum dispatch. Managing efficient forecasting while ensuring the least possible prediction error is one of the main challenges posed in the grid today, considering the uncertainty and granularity in SG data. This paper presents a comprehensive and application-oriented review of state-of-the-art forecasting methods for SG systems along with recent developments in probabilistic deep learning (PDL) considering different models and architectures. Traditional point forecasting methods including statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are extensively investigated in terms of their applicability to energy forecasting. In addition, the significance of hybrid and data pre-processing techniques to support forecasting performance is also studied. A comparative case study using the Victorian electricity consumption and American electric power (AEP) datasets is conducted to analyze the performance of point and probabilistic forecasting methods. The analysis demonstrates higher accuracy of the long-short term memory (LSTM) models with appropriate hyper-parameter tuning among point forecasting methods especially when sample sizes are larger and involve nonlinear patterns with long sequences.

"Drug discovery is a multi-stage process that comprises two costly major steps: pre-clinical research and clinical trials. Among its stages, lead optimization easily consumes more than half of the pre-clinical budget. We propose a combined machine learning and molecular modeling approach that automates lead optimization workflow \textit{in silico}. The initial data collection is achieved with physics-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Contact matrices are calculated as the preliminary features extracted from the simulations. To take advantage of the temporal information from the simulations, we enhanced contact matrices data with temporal dynamism representation, which are then modeled with unsupervised convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Finally, conventional clustering method and CVAE-based clustering method are compared with metrics to rank the submolecular structures and propose potential candidates for lead optimization. With no need for extensive structure-activity relationship database, our method provides new hints for drug modification hotspots which can be used to improve drug efficacy. Our workflow can potentially reduce the lead optimization turnaround time from months/years to days compared with the conventional labor-intensive process and thus can potentially become a valuable tool for medical researchers.",agreed well with the previous binding structure reported by Zhang et al 44 where the binding pocket facilitated hydrogen bonds between the 8 hydroxyl groups in sucrose and hydrophilic residues in T 1 R 2 Such hydroxyl group facilitated sweetness was suggested more than half a century ago and has remained a heavily investigated topic 25 36 5 The stable binding structures of the rest of the five sweeteners were illustrated in FigureS 3 We found that the crucial binding residues for 4 R Cl sucrose included D 142 E 302 Y 103 N 143 Y 164 S 165 A 166 T 184 Y 215 S 303 W 304 I 306 V 309 L 310 I 325 T 326 I 327 R 383 and S 387 highly similar to those of sucrose This indicated that the binding mechanism mainly remained the same after changing one hydroxyl group of the sucrose to the chlorine atom in 4 R Cl sucrose In contrast the crucial binding residues for sucralose D 142 E 302 L 41 I 67 L 71 S 144 Y 164 S 165 A 166 I 167 T 184 H 190 S 303 A 305 V 309 and V 384 included more residues on the slightly more hydrophobic lips region of the flytrap This shift was expected because 3 relatively more hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of the sucrose were modified to 3 chlorine atoms in sucralose Nevertheless D 142 and E 302 remained crucial as hydrogen bond receptors for sucralose The stable binding structure of du lc in interacted with mostly hydrophilic residues L 41 Y 103 D 142 Y 164 S 165 T 184 P 185 H 190 E 302 S 303 A 305 I 306 T 326 I 327 R 383 V 384 S 387 and L 448 similar to those of sucrose and 4 R Cl sucrose The main hydrogen bonds appeared to be between the urea group of du lc in and D 142 Finally the stable binding structure of iso van illy l interacted with F 39 S 40 L 41 V 64 I 67 L 71 Y 103 D 142 Y 164 S 165 Y 215 E 302 S 303 V 309 V 384 V 385 S 387 V 388 indicating a binding domain that was more hydrophobic and similar to,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Pulmonary diseases impact millions of lives globally and annually. The recent outbreak of the pandemic of the COVID-19, a novel pulmonary infection, has more than ever brought the attention of the research community to the machine-aided diagnosis of respiratory problems. This paper is thus an effort to exploit machine learning for classification of respiratory problems and proposes a framework that employs as much correlated information (auditory and demographic information in this work) as a dataset provides to increase the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnosing system. First, we use deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to process and classify a publicly released pulmonary auditory dataset, and then we take advantage of the existing demographic information within the dataset and show that the accuracy of the pulmonary classification increases by 5% when trained on the auditory information in conjunction with the demographic information. Since the demographic data can be extracted using computer vision, we suggest using another parallel DCNN to estimate the demographic information of the subject under test visioned by the processing computer. Lastly, as a proposition to bring the healthcare system to users' fingertips, we measure deployment characteristics of the auditory DCNN model onto processing components of an NVIDIA TX2 development board.",A Oliveira CJ come A Marques et al 2017 A respiratory sound database In an attempt to exploit machine learning algorithms to classify for the development of automated classification In International Conference on respiratory problems we proposed a framework that employs as Biomedical and Health Informatics Springer 33 37 18 Bruno M Rocha Dimitri s Filo s Lu s Mendes Go rke m Serb es Sezer Ul u kaya much correlated information as a data set provides and showed Yas emin PKa hy a Nik aJa kov lj evi c Tat jan aLT uruk alo Ioann is MV ogi atz is that with combining both auditory and demographic information Elen i Per antoni et al 2019 An open access database for the evaluation of for a selection of reasonably balanced data set out of a publicly respiratory sound classification algorithms Physiological measurement 40 3 2019 035001 released respiratory sound database the diagnosis accuracy of the 19 Hee chang Ryu J ink yoo Park and Ha yong Shin 2016 Classification of heart trained deep convolutional neural networks DCNN s increases by sound recordings using convolution neural network In 2016 Computing in Card i ology Conference C inC IEEE 1153 1156 5 Since the demographic data can be extracted and estimated 20 Zee nat Tariq Saye dK hush al Shah and Yu gyun gLee 2019 Lung Disease Class i using computer vision we suggest using another DCNN that works fi cation using Deep Convolutional Neural Network In 2019 IEEE International in parallel to the auditory signal processing DCNN to estimate Conference on Bioinformatics and Bio medicine B IBM IEEE 732 735 21 Yuji Toko zum e and Tatsuya Harada 2017 Learning environmental sounds with the demographic information of the subject under test Lastly we end to end convolutional neural network In 2017 IEEE International Conference deploy our DCNN models on a dual core Denver CPU a quad on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing I CASS P IEEE 2721 2725 22 Zhi fei Zhang Yang Song and Hair ong Qi 2017 Age progression regression core ARM Cortex A 57 and a heterogeneous implementation of by conditional adversarial Autoencoder In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on CPU GPU from the NVIDIA TX 2 development board to measure computer vision and pattern recognition 5810 5818 hardware characteristics when deploying the model to an embedded 23 Xian xian Zhao Bil i Zhang Pan Li Chao qu nM a Jia we iGu Pan Hou Zhi fu Guo HongWu and Yuan Bai 2020 Incidence clinical characteristics and device prognostic factor of patients with C OVID 19 a systematic review and meta analysis Me dR xiv 2020,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Prediction of seizure before they occur is vital for bringing normalcy to the lives of patients. Researchers employed machine learning methods using hand-crafted features for seizure prediction. However, ML methods are too complicated to select the best ML model or best features. Deep Learning methods are beneficial in the sense of automatic feature extraction. One of the roadblocks for accurate seizure prediction is scarcity of epileptic seizure data. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic EEG samples. We use two methods to validate synthesized data namely, one-class SVM and a new proposal which we refer to as convolutional epileptic seizure predictor (CESP). Another objective of our study is to evaluate performance of well-known deep learning models (e.g., VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3) by training models on augmented data using transfer learning with average time of 10 min between true prediction and seizure onset. Our results show that CESP model achieves sensitivity of 78.11% and 88.21%, and FPR of 0.27/h and 0.14/h for training on synthesized and testing on real Epilepsyecosystem and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Effective results of CESP trained on synthesized data shows that synthetic data acquired the correlation between features and labels very well. We also show that employment of idea of transfer learning and data augmentation in patient-specific manner provides highest accuracy with sensitivity of 90.03% and 0.03 FPR/h which was achieved using Inceptionv3, and that augmenting data with samples generated from DCGAN increased prediction results of our CESP model and Inceptionv3 by 4-5% as compared to state-of-the-art traditional augmentation techniques.

"A primary goal of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Warn-on-Forecast (WoF) project is to provide rapidly updating probabilistic guidance to human forecasters for short-term (e.g., 0-3 h) severe weather forecasts. Maximizing the usefulness of probabilistic severe weather guidance from an ensemble of convection-allowing model forecasts requires calibration. In this study, we compare the skill of a simple method using updraft helicity against a series of machine learning (ML) algorithms for calibrating WoFS severe weather guidance. ML models are often used to calibrate severe weather guidance since they leverage multiple variables and discover useful patterns in complex datasets. \indent Our dataset includes WoF System (WoFS) ensemble forecasts available every 5 minutes out to 150 min of lead time from the 2017-2019 NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed Spring Forecasting Experiments (81 dates). Using a novel ensemble storm track identification method, we extracted three sets of predictors from the WoFS forecasts: intra-storm state variables, near-storm environment variables, and morphological attributes of the ensemble storm tracks. We then trained random forests, gradient-boosted trees, and logistic regression algorithms to predict which WoFS 30-min ensemble storm tracks will correspond to a tornado, severe hail, and/or severe wind report. For the simple method, we extracted the ensemble probability of 2-5 km updraft helicity (UH) exceeding a threshold (tuned per severe weather hazard) from each ensemble storm track. The three ML algorithms discriminated well for all three hazards and produced more reliable probabilities than the UH-based predictions. Overall, the results suggest that ML-based calibrations of dynamical ensemble output can improve short term, storm-scale severe weather probabilistic guidance",Random forests Bre iman output focus on coherent regions of interest rather than 2001 have produced competitive next day hail predictions strictly analyzing forecasts on a point by point basis Wil Gag ne et al 2017 Burke et al 2019 reliable next day sonet al 2019 severe weather hazard guidance L oken et al 2020 and To provide a baseline against which to test the ML mod even outperformed the Storm Prediction Center SPC Day els performance the probability of 2 5 km mid level UH 2 and 3 outlooks Hille tal 2020 Neural networks have exceeding a threshold tuned persevere weather hazard is also shown success in predicting next day severe weather extracted from each Ensemble storm track similar to Flora and were more skillful than an UH baseline in So bash et al 2019 We hypothesize that the ML based ca libra et al 2020 A key advantage of ML models is their a bil t ions should outperform a nUH based baseline especially it y to leverage multiple input predictors and learn complex in cases of severe non rotating thunderstorms or inen vi relationships to produce skillful calibrated probabilistic ron ment s where supercells are less common guidance An additional advantage for real time opera The structure of the paper is as follows Sections 2 t ional settings is that once an ML model has been trained and 3 describe the W oF S forecast datasets and the data making predictions on new data is computationally quick processing procedures respectively Section 4 describes cid 28 1 s per example the ML models and methods used in this study We present The goal of this study is to evaluate the skill andre lia bil the results in Section 5 with conclusions and limitations of it y of ML based calibrations of the W oF system W oF S the study discussed in Section 6 severe weather probabilistic guidance To accomplish this goal we trained gradient boosted classification trees,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"A growing number of people are seeking healthcare advice online. Usually, they diagnose their medical conditions based on the symptoms they are experiencing, which is also known as self-diagnosis. From the machine learning perspective, online disease diagnosis is a sequential feature (symptom) selection and classification problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the standard approaches to this type of tasks. Generally, they perform well when the feature space is small, but frequently become inefficient in tasks with a large number of features, such as the self-diagnosis. To address the challenge, we propose a non-RL Bipartite Scalable framework for Online Disease diAgnosis, called BSODA. BSODA is composed of two cooperative branches that handle symptom-inquiry and disease-diagnosis, respectively. The inquiry branch determines which symptom to collect next by an information-theoretic reward. We employ a Product-of-Experts encoder to significantly improve the handling of partial observations of a large number of features. Besides, we propose several approximation methods to substantially reduce the computational cost of the reward to a level that is acceptable for online services. Additionally, we leverage the diagnosis model to estimate the reward more precisely. For the diagnosis branch, we use a knowledge-guided self-attention model to perform predictions. In particular, BSODA determines when to stop inquiry and output predictions using both the inquiry and diagnosis models. We demonstrate that BSODA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets. Moreover, we propose a novel evaluation method to test the transferability of symptom checking methods from synthetic to real-world tasks. Compared to existing RL baselines, BSODA is more effectively scalable to large search spaces.",could be Number of Monte Carlo samples obtained even in medium search spaces Ka chu eee tal 16 pro Parameters of the VAE encoder decoder posed a method based on deep Q-Learning with variations of model Predictive distribution from the diagnosis model uncertainty as the reward function Xia et al 45 implemented M Mask matrix a nRL agent for symptom checking using Generative Adversarial P Conditional probability matrix Network GAN and policy gradient method which performed well A Attention matrix on two public datasets containing instances of four and five d is e E Embedding vector s of feature s eases respectively However such a small number of diseases is impractical in most real world situations Line tal 28 proposed to combine an inquiry branch of aQ network with a diagnosis branch 3 1 2 ED DI A variation al Autoencoder VAE 19 defines age ner that involves a generative sampler It was only effective on the two at ive model of the form x z cid 206 z z in which the data small datasets mentioned previously Liao et al 27 proposed a x is generated from latent variables z z is a prior e g spherical hierarchical RL framework with a master for worker appointment Gaussian and x z is presented as a neural network decoder several workers for symptom inquiry and a separate worker for with parameters to specify a simple likelihood e g Bernoulli A screening diseases Liu et al 29 improved it by using a pre training VAE uses another neural network with parameters as an encoder strategy to overcome difficulties in convergence However their to produce a variation al approximation of the posterior that is maximum manageable number of diseases is 90 and the model did z x AVAE is trained by maximizing an evidence lower bound not perform well in current datasets EL BO E z x log x z KL z x z 1,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Protein gamma-turn prediction is useful in protein function studies and
experimental design. Several methods for gamma-turn prediction have been
developed, but the results were unsatisfactory with Matthew correlation
coefficients (MCC) around 0.2-0.4. One reason for the low prediction accuracy
is the limited capacity of the methods; in particular, the traditional
machine-learning methods like SVM may not extract high-level features well to
distinguish between turn or non-turn. Hence, it is worthwhile exploring new
machine-learning methods for the prediction. A cutting-edge deep neural
network, named Capsule Network (CapsuleNet), provides a new opportunity for
gamma-turn prediction. Even when the number of input samples is relatively
small, the capsules from CapsuleNet are very effective to extract high-level
features for classification tasks. Here, we propose a deep inception capsule

"Automatic recognition of the historical letters (XI-XVIII centuries) carved
