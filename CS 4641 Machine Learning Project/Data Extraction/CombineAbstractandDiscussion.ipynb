Khalil et al. proposed an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework, S2V-DQN, which automatically learns graph embeddings to construct solutions to a wide range of problems. To improve the generalization ability of their Q-learning method, we propose a novel learning strategy based on AlphaGo Zero which is a Go engine that achieved a superhuman level without the domain knowledge of the game. Our framework is redesigned for combinatorial problems, where the final reward might take any real number instead of a binary response, win/lose. In experiments conducted for five kinds of NP-hard problems including {\\\\sc MinimumVertexCover} and {\\\\sc MaxCut}, our method is shown to generalize better to various graphs than S2V-DQN. Furthermore, our method can be combined with recently-developed graph neural network (GNN) models such as the \\\\emph{Graph Isomorphism Network}, resulting in even better performance.

Khalil et al. proposed an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework, S2V-DQN, which automatically learns graph embeddings to construct solutions to a wide range of problems. To improve the generalization ability of their Q-learning method, we propose a novel learning strategy based on AlphaGo Zero which is a Go engine that achieved a superhuman level without the domain knowledge of the game. Our framework is redesigned for combinatorial problems, where the final reward might take any real number instead of a binary response, win/lose.

Khalil et al. proposed an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework, S2V-DQN, which automatically learns graph embeddings to construct solutions to a wide range of problems. To improve the generalization ability of their Q-learning method, we propose a novel learning strategy based on AlphaGo Zero which is a Go engine that achieved a superhuman level without the domain knowledge of the game. Our framework is redesigned for combinatorial problems, where the final reward might take any real number instead of a binary response, win/lose. In experiments conducted for five kinds of NP-hard problems including {\\\\sc MinimumVertexCover} and {\\\\sc MaxCut}, our method is shown to generalize better to various graphs than S2V-DQN. Furthermore, our method can be combined with recently-developed graph neural network (GNN) models such as the \\\\emph{Graph Isomorphism Network}, resulting in even better performance. This experiment also gives an interesting insight into a suitable choice of GNN models for each task.\",\n          \"With the recent implementation of the K to 12 Program, academic institutions, specifically, Colleges and Universities in the Philippines have been faced with difficulties in determining projected freshmen enrollees vis-a-vis decision-making factors for efficient resource management. Enrollment targets directly impacts success factors of Higher Education Institutions. This study covered an analysis of various characteristics of freshmen applicants affecting their admission status in a Philippine university. A predictive model was developed using Logistic Regression to evaluate the probability that an admitted student will pursue to enroll in the Institution or not. The dataset used was acquired from the University Admissions Office. The office designed an online application form to capture applicants' details. The online form was distributed to all student applicants, and most often, students, tend to provide incomplete information. Despite this fact, student characteristics, as well as geographic and demographic data based on the students' location are significant predictors of enrollment decision. The results of the study show that given limited information about prospective students, Higher Education Institutions can implement machine learning techniques to supplement management decisions and provide estimates of class sizes, in this way, it will allow the institution to optimize the allocation of resources and will have better control over net tuition revenue.\",\n          \"Multi-fidelity methods are prominently used when cheaply-obtained, but\\npossibly biased and noisy, observations must be effectively combined with\\nlimited or expensive true data in order to construct reliable models.
