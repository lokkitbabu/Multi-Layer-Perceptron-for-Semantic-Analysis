Beyond an educational resource\\nfor ML, the browser has vast potential to not only improve the state-of-the-art\\nin ML research, but also, inexpensively and on a massive scale, to bring\\nsophisticated ML learning and prediction to the public at large. This paper\\nintroduces MLitB, a prototype ML framework written entirely in JavaScript,\\ncapable of performing large-scale distributed computing with heterogeneous\\nclasses of devices. The development of MLitB has been driven by several\\nunderlying objectives whose aim is to make ML learning and usage ubiquitous (by\\nusing ubiquitous compute devices), cheap and effortlessly distributed, and\\ncollaborative. This is achieved by allowing every internet capable device to\\nrun training algorithms and predictive models with no software installation and\\nby saving models in universally readable formats. Our prototype library is\\ncapable of training deep neural networks with synchronized, distributed\\nstochastic gradient descent. MLitB offers several important opportunities for\\nnovel ML research, including: development of distributed learning algorithms,\\nadvancement of web GPU algorithms, novel field and mobile applications, privacy\\npreserving computing, and green grid-computing. MLitB is available as open\\nsource software.\",\n          \"As machine learning algorithms are increasingly applied to high impact yet high risk tasks, such as medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, it is critical that researchers can explain how such algorithms arrived at their predictions. In recent years, a number of image saliency methods have been developed to summarize where highly complex neural networks \\\"look\\\" in an image for evidence for their predictions. However, these techniques are limited by their heuristic nature and architectural constraints. In this paper, we make two main contributions: First, we propose a general framework for learning different kinds of explanations for any black box algorithm. Second, we specialise the framework to find the part of an image most responsible for a classifier decision. Unlike previous works, our method is model-agnostic and testable because it is grounded in explicit and interpretable image perturbations.\",\n          \"In complex inferential tasks like question answering, machine learning models\\nmust confront two challenges: the need to implement a compositional reasoning\\nprocess, and, in many applications, the need for this reasoning process to be\\ninterpretable to assist users in both development and prediction. Existing\\nmodels designed to produce interpretable traces of their decision-making\\nprocess typically require these traces to be supervised at training time. In\\nthis paper, we present a novel neural modular approach that performs\\ncompositional reasoning by automatically inducing a desired sub-task\\ndecomposition without relying on strong supervision. Our model allows linking\\ndifferent reasoning tasks though shared modules that handle common routines\\nacross tasks. Experiments show that the model is more interpretable to human\\nevaluators compared to other state-of-the-art models: users can better\\nunderstand the model's underlying reasoning procedure and predict when it will\\nsucceed or fail based on observing its intermediate outputs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n
